count vectorization has been implemented. Look into possibly reducing the size of vector space.

use the resulting feature vector to implement learning. Since we are likely working in high-dimensional space, a linear
  separator looks appealing. Probably logistic regression. 
  
Start out with a binary class label, and work up to as many as 30.
