This means the heat is actually generated from inside the food, and not just blasting the outside surface of the food.  Microwaves can heat more parts of the food at once this way.  This heat then spreads to other parts of the food, heating it up.  If you've ever eaten something that was heated in the microwave and it had cold spots, it's because those spots had less water (or the microwaves aren't evenly distributed within the chamber).  This is why most microwave cooking instructions tell you to let the food rest, so that the heat can reach equilibrium throughout the food and you won't have cold spots.  Interestingly, this property is also what prevents most non-food objects from heating up in the microwave; they contain no moisture so they don't vibrate and thus don't generate heat. ", "On the other hand, ovens use a heating element (electric or gas, usually) to heat the air in the oven (convection), which means heat transfer must occur from the outside-in. As each \"layer\" of food is cooked, the next layer wants to reach equilibrium and starts taking heat from the warmer layers.  This process is called conduction.  It takes longer for each layer to heat because the previous layer needs to heat up first in order to transfer heat inward.  This process takes much longer, but unlike a microwave you don't end up with the uneven heating problem and don't need to let your food rest so the heat can be evenly distributed.

The heating element in the oven heats the air around it, which in turn passes the heat to the air particles around that, and so on. Also, hot air rises and circulates allowing colder air to come into contact with the heating element. Air is not very dense, and has poor heat capacity and conductivity, there are not many atoms and molecules per volume to 'hold' the heat and thus pass it on. As examples, you could put your hand inside an oven at 200c for a few seconds, and be fine, but (don't) try putting you hand into boiling water at 100c for any seconds.

Air is a terrible conductor, really.", "For comparison, boiling things is faster then baking them, because of the density of water. The downside is that it can leech things out if they are water soluble, which lots of flavors are.  Microwaving allows for a very high power coupling without leeching, using a different mechanism than traditional conduction (it vibrates specifically water molecules, sort of like how your car can vibrate really hard at certain RPMs, by hitting a resonance frequency) but often cooks things in an undesirable way because it couples to the most exterior water in the food, which it will heat much faster than the material itself conducts heat. That's why the middle can be cold even if the outside is disturbingly hot. That's why using a lower power setting or stirring things often are useful for cooking things better in a microwave.", "ITT everyone thinks microwaves cause water molecules to vibrate. They don't, water molecules are too small and their fundamental frequency is too high. They cause the water molecules to rotate.  ", "Besides that the explanations are good. ", "Heat is movement. The hotter something is, the faster the molecules inside move.", "An oven has hot air, the molecules in the air move faster than the ones in your meal and each time they hit the molecules of your meal they'll accelerate them.

The hypothesis states that emotional \"markers\", such as the sweating and rapid heart beat associated with anxiety, help us to make decisions where cognition alone might fail us. The parts of the brain associated with the somatic marker hypothesis are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. When damage to these areas occur (such as in traumatic brain injury) it has been found that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions on gambling tasks. Why? Because they aren't experiencing the same emotional reaction to betting or losing, meaning they are less likely to \"learn from their mistakes\" because they don't experience or process disappointment or regret in the same way. There are lots of studies done on this using something called the Iowa Gambling Task. That's just one example of how emotions impact decision making.

Your brain is producing dopamine, and receiving it. Neurotransmitters travel from axons in your brain, to dendrites, where I like to think of axons as a driveway, and a dendrite is where you park at the end of it (there's actually a little gap between the two physically but I digress). So you create dopamine, receive it within a dendrite and after a while it gets spent.

It's often said meditation helps show you how to sit at the train station and decide whether or not you want to get on the train of thought that's passing by.

Second, because evolution tends to co-opt existing structures for new means, our emotions ride on the same nervous system as pain and pleasure.

Research in recent years suggests that we use the same pool of cognitive resources to regulate our emotions, as well as performing analytical thinking, making choices, keeping up persistence, etc. If you exhaust yourself mentally with too many conscious tasks, or do not get enough rest, you might deplete the cognitive resources that normally keep negative emotions in check, which may lead to the scenario you described -- getting sad without apparent triggers.", "I think there's a spirit of sadness in the world from all the tragic things that happen and some people are just more in tune to it, like an antenna of sadness", "I am very happy and content with my life but for some reason, my face can't express it and people always end up asking me, why are you looking so sad today.

C4 plants have a clever adaptation to one big efficiency-loss. the chemical that binds CO2 in plants, so that it gets from the air into the plant cell, can also bind oxygen. you could increase CO2-concentration(that's done sometimes in greenhouses), so there's more CO2 vs. oxygen. C4 plants do something like that too, they use a different chemical, that only binds CO2, and then transport the CO2 into a kind of airducts in the leaf where the CO2 concentration becomes very high and the original chemical can do it's work with high efficiency.", "however, it's not easy to turn a C3('normal' plant) into a C4, since it's not just that one chemical, but also the airducts in the leaf. (little sidenote, it's not like C4 is rare, maize is C4 for example) and C4 do better at higher temperatures, so in temperate regions there's not that much to gain from turning a C3 into a C4. and actually, the reason that there is interest in turning C3 into C4 is due to using less water, not more CO2. since they can deal with lower CO2 concentrations, they can keep their stomata closed more often, so they evaporate less water.", "and last, I think you're thinking of gmo as magic a bit too much. gmo sounds like it can do everything, but there are actually still a lot of problems. if you know what you want(let's say plant without hairs on leaf, C4 photosynthesis including the leaf anatomy), you need to find all the genes that do those things first. that is possible, but it's still something that takes time, money  and researchers. then you need to find a way to paste those genes into an existing plant, and grow a healthy plant where the editing succeeded and that can reproduce. and then you need to do breeding to actually make that plant good. if you made a gmo supertomato that is resistent to any pest, but you get shitty tasteless, small, green tomatoes, it's still worthless.", "Short answer: That's true, and we are researching ways to make CO2 capture faster.

Other projects of a smaller scope were funded at or around the same time by the aerospace industry (esp. Boeing, Virgin, etc.) and by the US Air Force.", "The concept remains unproven, but promising. Microorganisms have much greater access to and exchange with their environment than terrestrial plants, because each cell can exchange nutrients directly with the medium in which they are suspended, and because energy is minimally expended in nonusable ways, such as in the structures that plants develop. Algae that are tolerant of high light levels can also be absolutely blasted with sunlight, to greatly enhance productivity. Some microorganisms were found or engineered which rapidly create lipids (oil) and store it away in sacs, which can be readily obtained by lysing (killing and breaking open) the cells.

More absorption of CO2 means just more biomass for the plant/algae/bacteria in question. We could probably cultivate in each home a pond of just normal algae and then our problems would be solved, no genetic modifiers needed as algae/phytoplanktons are already such monsters in producing more biomass faster than any plant life thus consuming more CO2. When it comes to the speed of growth, the more simple the structure the faster the biomass increases. Algae do not have to spend that much energy into forming leaves, trunks, and branches thus more of their energy is spent into increasing biomass.", "But it isn't that simple. You see if you were to cultivate an enormous amount of algae, it still has a life cycle, thus when it dies, CO2 goes back again to the atmosphere. You wouldn't really lower the amount of atmospheric CO2, this is of course assuming that you just grew algae naturally such that it follows the seasons. If you cultivated them artificially such that they maintain their biomass throughout the year then the CO2 cost of the use of artificial lights, aeration, fertilizer would probably just cancel out the amount of CO2 you eliminated from the atmosphere by cultivating them in the first place.", "The real problem is, how can we permanently hide away this carbon from biomass such that when the plant or algae dies, the CO2 from decay does not go back to the atmosphere. This area is where we need to innovate. This whole procedure of cultivating biomass and stopping it into becoming atmospheric is called ", ". This procedure entails the injecting and locking of biomass into geologic formations. Simply put you are manually pumping back carbon into the process that forms fossil fuels. Pumping carbon biomass into geologic formations is the only way I have read to successfully finish the sequestering of carbon, which would otherwise have been in the atmosphere. Such geologic formations are unfortunately not widespread and accessible, if they were we would have been doing this in a wide scale. We should learn how to trap carbon in the biomass fast, so that we benefit from the super fast growth of algae. When we have discovered an efficient process of sequestering, then all we have to do is grow algae/plants, harvest them, lock them away, and in a few years carbon would go back to normal.", "Part of my high school and college theses have touched on these subjects.", "In my HS thesis, we proved that urea dumping to promote algal blooms for purposes of lowering atmospheric carbon can be detrimental to marine life. Urea destroys egg cells of marine animals and would hinder their reproduction. Not exactly directly addressing the global warming problem, but nonetheless the related literature that me and my group-mates have read touch on the use of algal life to promote the lowering of atmospheric CO2.", "My college thesis concerns the design of an efficient microbial fuel cell. In summary, this MFC would produce electricity. Anaerobic bacteria is in the anode and algae is in the cathode. Wastewater is fed to the anode chamber then oxidized and filtered by the bacteria.

It's actually a lot better than it was, basic in the 2000s gdp was like less than 10 trillion and debt was more than 16 trillion, but that doesn't matter. The reason it doesn't matter is because people are still always willing to lend the us government money. And I don't mean like bank loans, anybody can lend the government money by buying bonds or securities. Basically these amount to micro loans to the government. You buy a $1000 savings bond that pays $1250 in 3 years, that's basically you lending the government a 3 yr $1000 loan with whatever interest rate. Bonds are always good and people are always buying them; basically this is like saying the government can always go into more and more debt because people will always be willing to lend the government money. There's a lot of reasons behind this, not the least of which is the us governments reputation for paying back these investments but also that these investments are done in dollars which is a strong, reliable currency. Some governments aren't as good about paying back loans like this or they pay back the loans by printing more money which lowers the value, so you my buy a 1000 jigger bond from jiggerland that pays 1250 jiggers in 3 years, but after 3 years one jiggers only worth what half a jigger from 3 years ago was worth so the 1250 jiggers they give you back are actually worth less than the 1000 you started with.\nThis is basically what's going on between Japan and Greece. Japan is in a lot of debt, but basically Japan is still reliable to loan money too. They will pay you back on time and what they pay you back with will legitimately be worth more than what you originally lent them. Greece on the other hand has a reputation for sucking at this. They'll probably pay you back what they said they would, maybe on time, but more than likely it won't be worth more, or much more than you originally lent to them. There's also a marketing thing where like Japanese bonds are more reliable, so more investors want them, which in turn makes them more expensive and harder to get. Greek bonds on the other had are super cheap and easy to get, but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained.", "You've already got a lot of great responses but I'm going to go ahead and copy a post I made in a ", ":", "National debt is very, very complicated in whether it is \"good\" or \"bad\".

It's exactly as affordable to you, even though you're in more debt than the guy with the worse interest rate.", "That's very important because interest rates vary a lot among Nations. The United States has a really low interest rate because the trust that it will pay back its money is so high. In 2013 the average interest rate the US was paying was apparently 2.43%. At around that time at the peak of the Greek debt crisis it was selling ten year bonds with over a 25% interest rate. (Note that unfortunately total averages to \"Bonds sold at the peak of the crises\" is not an apples to apples comparison. Unfortunately I couldn't find National averages for Greece, which are going to be much lower than that 25%)", "If you only compare debt to GDP ratios you miss that very, very crucial part of the puzzle.", "However, there is a way in which the affordability of your debt CAN swing wildly, and that's if a lot of it is in a currency that you don't control (which is why the Danish article is good news for them). Typically as nations struggle financially their currency loses value. If their debt is in that currency then there isn't much of a difference. The majority of their revenue probably comes from taxes and other things that are in that weaker currency, and they are paying off their debts in that weaker currency, it all balances out. However, if instead the debt is in another currency, you start to be in big trouble. If your currency drops 20% and your monthly payments go up 20%... well that can be the start of a hell of a death spiral.\nThis interplay is actually one of the big criticisms of the Eurozone. Countries like Italy and Greece are struggling economically, but their currency isn't devaluing like it would if they had their own currency. Instead it is remaining buoyed up by all of the healthy Eurozone countries.

Listeria is a common cause of food born illness because the organism itself doesn't make us sick, rather it produces waste products that are poisonous to us.

Take botulism for instance; the bacteria create a poison as they multiply and it's the poison that makes us sick, not the bacteria. That poison ends up deposited in the food and so eating it is literally eating poison. And much the same way the stomach doesn't turn protein into carbon, it doesn't turn poison into carbon, it stays as poison.

There are some microbes, such as helicobacter pylori that are able to evade this acidity by secreting neutralising agents, along with burrowing into the stomach cells and hiding in a sense. Other times, the microbes actually don't survive, but their exotoxins (the things they secrete that make us sick or cause injury to our cells) are stable enough to survive their time in the stomach.

So in that example the stomach acid is part of its toxicity.", "Maybe this isn't what was being asked, but we often get sick from microbes, especially viruses such as influenza, that cause infections in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. The infection starts in your nose or throat before the microbe would even come in contact with stomach acid.

The few who are able to do so are able to make us sick by two main reasons; they irritate the stomach lining by attacking the cells that make it up, which leads to an immune system response in a part of the brain called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, causing nausea/vomiting to remove the toxins from the stomach.", "Two main reasons stand out for me. The first is that many of the bacterial/microbial molecules which make us sick are glycosylated (decorated with sugars) which make sensitive areas resistant to acidic and enzymatic breakdown. The second example is that H. pylori which resides in your stomach takes advantage of the gradient of acidity in your stomach. The lumen (open area further from the lining in contact with food) is most acidic (though not always! Depending on what you eat/drink, the pH of your stomach can be pH 6, or slightly acidic) followed by a gradient of acidity through the protective mucus lining, finally reaching pH 7 (neutral) at the cell lining.

If those bacteria are good enough at surviving, they will divide and make more bacteria that also have the same adaptation. ", "These adaptations come from mutations. Every time a cell divides, there's a chance for a small mutation, that might change the new cell. One of these mutations might cause the cell to do better in your stomach, and be able to survive long enough to divide.", "These mutations build on themselves over time, and eventually you might have a single bacteria capable of surviving in your stomach, that reproduces out of control and makes you sick with whatever it's doing.

So when the oscars come around and they say X was the best movie of the year people can compare it to how they think a story should be told and they can agree or come up with some reasonable list of reasons why it deviated from the ideal and people kind of understand each other because there is a vague set of rules.", "Compare that to music, where some people certainly approach it as telling a story, but most don't.

Riskier films are relegated to low budget \"arty\" experiments, and from time to time these do pay off. (Especially as there are many more of these in comparison to big-budget films.)

The energy from the outside is in the form of (mainly) fat and carbohydrates, and requires oxygen to properly process it. This in turn increases the need for oxygen, and the heart starts to pump faster, and you start to breath faster.

With aerobic exercise it's not just that your heart is beating faster. Your heart is beat to supply your body systems with enough oxygen and to remove buildup of CO2. Regular exercise causes your heart to pump more efficiently as your stroke volume (amount of blood pushed per heartbeat) and contractility improve (how hard it is contracting). You also improve in other ways, you develop more capillaries in your skin and muscle. Your muscles become more aerobic in nature by gaining more mitochondria. Your body becomes more efficient at providing oxygen, using oxygen to make ATP, then removing acid and Co2 buildup. Essentially it beats because your parasympathetic nervous system backs off control and your sympathetic nervous system picks it up and says \"GOGOGOGO!\".", "Now when your heart is beating fast because of drugs or anxiety it's not because your body needs more oxygen or waste removed. It's the drugs hijacking the receptors that normally control your heartrate and just telling your heart to go balls to the wall. With caffeine the heart rate increase can also be erratic which is more harm than good. To explain this you need to understand how the heart beats. You have atriums and you have ventricles. The heart can move blood because it always contracts the atriums then the ventricles. If the atrium or ventricle contracts twice in a row it is not really moving any blood. This can be very dangerous as it can lead to an arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm.

Simple example: Say you pound 5 starbucks coffees a day and are obese, or lets say even overweight.

In early Mesopotamia it was also used as currency. Hell, Jewish slaves were paid in bowls of beer, it wasn't beer as we know it today, but it was a porridge-like substance that was created with grain and water. The pyramids were built on beer.", "I stated earlier that the reason why wine is used in Christianity is because it was easy to grow grapes in Italy and as Christianity spread through the Roman Empire that became the norm. If you couldn't grow grapes you had to buy it from Italians and thus helping their economy. It that time beer became a lesser drink in the eyes of many. ", "As beer became a drink and not just for food its secrets were passed down through the monks. Which has also been stated several times in this thread. What I havent seen mentioned is the importance of Reinheitsgebot. In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast).  This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find. It was called gruit  and it could include figs, dates, sticks, and even charcoal (again, not as refined as we know it today). Beer was important because it kept people alive, but some of the ingredients were killing people or making them sick. They decided on hops because, like the Counsel of Nicaea, they chose an available crop that was easy to grow in the area. Hops.", "Hops became the standard for the bittering agent in beer because both Germany and England could grow them and it helped the local economy. ", "Beer also helped the Champagne region of France with exploding bottles. The Belgians have many styles of beer that have residual sugars still in them, much like champagne. The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode.", "Pasteur was looking at wine when he discovered yeast, but IIRC refrigeration was developed to cool wort quicker. I have to look that up though. ", "Beer took a big hit after prohibition in America. With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony.  It wasn't until Carter passed a law in the 70's allowing for homebrewing that we see the start of the rise of craft beer in America. Styles that were dead became revitalized (i.e. IPA) and depth of the beverage really started to emerge.", "Beer is incredibly important to us as a society. It helped form us and shape how we became.

Wine dates back thousands of years, and in the AD calendar the importance of wine can't be underestimated (especially considering the rise of Christianity). There are monastic orders that have made beer for centuries (Trappist, others), but to my understanding wine has been an essential part of Catholic/Christian ceremonies for a long, long time. Wine even did relatively well during prohibition in the US because of church usage. So, I would argue wine is equally important, if not more.", "2) Include beer and wine, same question. My best guess would be that a lower alcohol percentage drink allows people to still be functional after consumption, where something like Brandy is going to make someone drunk, worthless, and a social outcast (you can't function when you're hammered, and especially in early cultures you had to be able to contribute to the group in some way).", "Also, distilled liquor required, well, a still. Wine or beer (I think) can theoretically be made in any kind of clay pot or vessel. Then liquor has to taste good. You still can't drink too much of it if it's high proof. There's centuries old liqueurs and Brandy and grappa that fit the bill, but for the few historical successes there must be thousands others there were lost to time because they didn't do a good job tasting good, being easy to produce, and allowing people to be functional.", "Just my best guess, I'm not great on the technical side of booze but I work in the restaurant industry and these conjectures are based on my limited understanding.

Yeast would have been airborne to start with, and both processes would likely have involved soaking the kernels to soften them. You could make bread from the solid bits, and the liquid bits would have been beer. It's an ancient drink. ", "In the Americas, the Wari went through a similar process with corn. Agriculture spread quickly across ancient Peru, because the Wari realized that by growing slightly more corn than you needed to live, you could brew it into a fantastic party drink. Their empire spread based on this teaching, they built huge stone terraces and had dance festivals, and worshiped gods of drink. The drinking cup was sacred. It was basically corn beer, and is still popular to this day.

Early man had no reliable access to clean, drinking water on a consistent basis sometimes, and as they did not understand the method of treating water, or boiling it to cleanse out impurities and kill bacteria, the creation of drinks like Mead and Beer allowed for a reliable way to create healthy, safe drinking fluids that could be drunk regardless of the water content (to an extent).", "Next, its storable. Water, back in the millenia ago, could easily become tainted. Leaving out barrels filled with water could inadvertantly introduce pests or contaminants that would ruin an entire barrel of fluid. Low-ABV liquids made contained just enough alcohol to make long term storage a viable means of transporting or storing liquid. This was especially important when out at sea, as water would only be good for 2-3 weeks before becoming contaminated by some means. A barrel of mead however, would stay good for weeks, or months, and if properly stored could keep a crew hydrated long after water would have gone bad.", "So there's actually a book called something like \"the history of the world in 6 glasses\" and it goes human development in the stages of what we drank: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea,  and coke  (coffee and tea might of been switched) I read it years ago for school but here's what I remember", "Beer: started a few thousands years after the agricultural revolution, or main crops were grains, so what water was inevitable.

I'll put a couple quotes from the book below:", "\"Beer, lest we forget, is the world's oldest recipe, first scribbled on a clay tabled by the Ancient Sumerians. It sustained early civilization; it helped build the Pyramids; it oiled the wheels of the Industrial Revolution in Britain; it stoked the fires of discontent that sparked the American one; it's what Elizabeth I had for breakfast; it's what Winston Churchill drank regardless of the time of day; it was the heartbeat of the British Empire; it started wars and it finished them; it was the drink of Henry VIII and Homer Simpson; and it is as Jack Nicholson so succinctly pointed out, 'the best damn drink in the world.'\"", "When Jesus Christ turns water into wine at a wedding \"It's his finest trick yet it fails to withstand even the most rudimentary form of scrutiny. Jesus would never have done that. We're not saying it couldn't be done, but if Jesus was going to turn water into any alcoholic beverage at a wedding, then it would definitely have been beer.\nYou don't have to delve deep into dusty tomes dating back centuries, as we have done, to know that Jesus was a beer guy. Just look at his clothes. As anyone who's ever been to a Real Ale festival will testify, Jesus bore all the hallmarks of a beer boffin--a beard and sandals. And he hung around with other men who had beards and sandals.\nLet's hit you with some historical fact here: Ancient Israel, where Jesus lived, was flanked by Egypt and Mesopotamia--both big beer nations. Mesopotamia was where the Sumerians first scribbled down the formula for brewing and in Ancient Egypt, beer was used as both an enema and currency (not the SAME beer). The chaps that built the Pyramids were paid with 10 pints of ale every day--which is why they forgot to put any windows in.\nGeographical evidence? In Ancient Israel, barley was grown and consumed in big quantities and not used only for bread-making. The soil was better suited to growing grain than grapes and regardless of gender or class, every Ancient Israelite would have drunk beer in Jesus's day.\nThe Bible is rife with references to beer (shekhar). Yahweh, God of Israel and the Judah kingdoms, drinks around 4 pints of beer every day (and even more on the Sabbath day), beer is eulogyzed as a medicine for melancholy (Proverbs 31:6), and moderate beer drinking is recommended--Isaiah 5:11, 28:7 Proverbs 20:1, 31:4) with over-indulgence discouraged.\nDespite numerous mentions in the original scriptures, beer often goes missing in modern translations. Why? Well, the etymological bone of contention centres on the Hebrew word shekhar, meaning \"strong drink\". Many attribute it to wine, but there's every indication to suggest that \"beer\" is the more faithful translation.\nOf the 20 times shekhar is mentioned, only once does it appear without the accompanying word for wine. What's more, the word shekhar derives from Sikaru, an ancient Semitic term meaning \"barley beer\".\nBut we reckon the real reason veer vanished from subsequent versions of the Bible is sheer scholarly snobbery. When the Bible was first translated into English in the early 17th century, beer was considered a pauper's drink, while wine was popular among \"posh\" folk.\nIn an astonishing display of academic arrogance, translators transformed Jesus Christ from a charitable beer-drinking friend of the people into a nouveau-riche playboy with designer sunglasses and leather loafers.\nBut that's not how Jesus rolled. He was a blue collar Messiah with no wish to drink wine. After all, the Romans drank wine and, as we all know, Jesus didn't get on with the Romans.\"", "One reason is that unlike wine or cider, beer does not make itself.", "If you go out and pick a bunch of apples/grapes and crush the juice out of them and leave it for a few days it'll start to ferment.

For most working class people, beer was both an essential source of nutrition and hydration  (it wasn't very alcoholic or carbonated. Think of it like an ancient protein shake.) The most important thing, however, was that it was cleaner than most water sources. Boiling water as a sanitation process wasn't quite known, but part of making beer is boiling wort (beer before beer becomes beer) which also sanitized it and made it safe to drink.

Communities would spring up when (often women) would open a saloon! Often they would be bordello's too, which goes hand in hand with taverns and saloons through history.

The reason for this is simple: it's really easy to make them. All you really need are access to fermentable sugars (grapes, barley, apples, honey) and a bucket. If you put those in a bucket with water, the naturally occurring yeast on the skins of the fruit, in the air, and in the bucket will ferment them for you. Nowadays, we add yeast, but it's not necessary to do so--that's just for quality control.", "Hard liquors, on the other hand, are harder to make. For those, you need more than just naturally occurring fermentation. Fermentation has an upper limit for ABV (around 25% with specially bred yeast; with primitive processes, probably in the 15-20% range). To get above that limit, you need special equipment and processes, either through freezing or boiling. As a result, these spirits developed much later than fermented ones.", "Beer, especially the lower alcohol (1-2%) unfiltered stuff, is essentially liquid bread. It's good for you! The alcohol in beer preserves the grain much longer than if you were to just bake bread with it thus stretching out your grain supply. Also it was very easy to make. Vikings would use a yeast covered stick to stir their sugary grain water concoction and it would magicly start fermenting.

Beer was initially used to store calories and other nutrients in a preservative.", "Now, I know this is very abstract (and I don't have evidence) and perhaps a bit pernickety, but the thing about beer being more important than other beverages is most likely attributable to the early modern era when Denmark was exporting the stuff like crazy. The beer they were selling was this bubbly hoppy drink, which was reminiscent of ale, a popular drink amongst the lower classes and peasants of their forefathers, but was mostly drunk by the lower classes; as opposed to wine, which was drunk by the upper classes. As such, during the explosion of the middle class leading to an opposition to feudal law, beer was the drink of people.", "However, ale, a more primitive form of delicious grainy alcohol, is the oldest form of fermentation we have record of, I'm not sure how old it is but I'm sure someone can back me up.

People that can commit $50k and 2 years of their time to just perfecting fake bills probably don't really care about getting $30-40 dollars off every third grocery order.

The mitochondrion is an organelle that functions like a cellular power plant. The mitochondrion processes fatty acids (and other fuels) to create a readily usable energy currency (ATP) to meet the energy needs of the muscle cell. Most fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria using a shuttle system called the carnitine shuttle (Holloway et al. 2008). The carnitine shuttle works by using two enzymes and carnitine (an amino acid-like molecule) to bring the fatty acids into the mitochondria. One of these enzymes is called carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPTI). CPT1 may work with one of the same proteins (FAT/CD36) used to bring fatty acids into the muscle cell from the blood (Holloway et al. 2008). Once inside the mitochondria, fatty acids are broken down through several enzymatic pathways including beta-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and the electron transport chain to produce ATP. ", ", which can be referred to as the fat-burning furnace in a person's body cells (as this is the only place TAG are completely broken down). As the chemical bonds in TAG molecules are broken up in metabolism they begin to lose electrons (a process called oxidation) and are picked up (a process called reduction) by electron transporters (NADH+H+ and FADH2). The electron transporters take the electrons to the electron transport chain for further oxidation, which leads to a liberation of energy that is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Unused energy becomes heat energy to sustain the body's core temperature. This ATP synthesizing process depends upon a steady supply of oxygen, which is why this process is aptly nicknamed \u201caerobic metabolism\u201d or \u201caerobic respiration.\u201d", " This reduced rate of fatty acid oxidation is coupled with an increase in carbohydrate breakdown to meet the energy demands of the exercise (Horowitz & Klein, 2000). ", "This counterintuitive drop in fat utilization during high intensity exercise is caused by several factors. One factor is related to blood flow to adipose tissue and thus reduced fatty acid supply to the muscle. At high exercise intensity, blood flow is shunted (or directed) away from adipose tissue so that fatty acids released from adipose tissue become \u201ctrapped\u201d in the adipose capillary beds, and are not carried to the muscle to be used (Horowitz and Klein, 2000). Another reason for reduced fat usage at high exercise intensities is related to the enzyme CPT1. CPT1 is important in the carnitine shuttle that moves fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. The activity of CPT1 can be reduced under conditions of high intensity exercise. Two mechanisms are thought to reduce CPT1 activity during intense exercise. As stated above, with increasing exercise intensity fatty acid oxidation drops while carbohydrate oxidation increases. The increased usage of carbohydrate leads to increased levels of a molecule called malonyl CoA inside the cell (Horowitz and Klein, 2000). Malonyl CoA can bind to and inhibit the activity of CPT1 (Achten and Jeukendrup, 2012).

So you will start physically feeling better and more motivated, but your mood is still low and you have negative thoughts. Also, for some people, especially if they have been depressed for a long time or if their depression was triggered by a traumatic event (death of a loved one, an accident, etc), an antidepressant alone might not be enough to counter the bad thoughts. Often you need to \"retrain your brain\" to learn how to not let yourself dwell and how to think more positively; this is why counseling or therapy is also a treatment for depression.", "Basically, a medicine can change how your brain works but it's harder to change what you think about.

It was more \"everyone would be better off if I were dead because I am so pathetic.\" Now, the thing about suicide is, it seems that oftentimes it is an impulsive decision. When electric stoves were introduced in the U.K., the suicide rate dropped because people couldn't kill themselves easily with gas ovens anymore, but the numbers for other methods didn't rise, suggesting if it were more difficult, less people would do it. Likewise, putting up guardrails on bridges that prevent jumpers has reduced overall suicide rates. I also recall seeing a study that said that the vast majority of people who attempt suicide and fail ", " So I see suicide not so much as a conscious decision of a rational mind (though it can be, for instance for the terminally ill) but as an impulse, a reflex almost, caused by depression the same way a cold makes you cough. So although I had no desire to kill myself, and was very aware of how painful that would have been for my family, I can definitely see how someone in the depths of that darkness could actually conclude that death would be preferable to carrying on with such a \"broken\" mind, and how suddenly having energy and a desire to \"do something\" could allow that person to act on their twisted thoughts. I mean, feeling physically better could even make the bad thoughts worse because it reinforces that \"it's all in your head,\" you start thinking what if there's nothing physically wrong with me, I'm worthless, I will never be happy, etc. Honestly, it terrifies me to think of suicide that way, but those are the conclusions I've drawn, and it makes me stay much more \"aware\" of my mood and be more open with my loved ones when I do feel down so they know to keep an eye on me. If you know someone who is depressed, they probably don't want to tell you if they are having those thoughts because they know it upsets people, but tell them you want to hear it and need them to help you protect them.

SSRIs increase the level of serotonin in this area (at the receptor area of the neuron). The increased level of serotonin in this area slowly (as the receptors turn over and get renewed) cause a decrease in the number of 5-HT1A receptors. These receptors normally inhibit the amount of serotonin released (from the end of the neuron), so as they are reduced, the amount of serotonin release at the other end of the neuron goes up.

Serotonin is largely implicated in depression and it is thought that having higher synaptic levels of this neurotransmitter helps us feel safe, calm, and happy.  Serotonin is released by neurons, travel across the synapse, and link up with receptors on neurons on the other side.  The serotonin is then reabsorbed back into the pre-synaptic neuron in a process called \"reuptake\".  SSRIs work to inhibit the reuptake process and keep more serotonin in the synapse, allowing it to stimulate the postsynaptic receptor more, theoretically keeping us happier.  When we flood out synapses with serotonin, these things called autoreceptors  go haywire.  They start to slow down production of serotonin because it appears to them that we have all we need.  Through a process of altering presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic receptors, everything gets straightened out, but it takes about a month.  In that month, serotonin dips a bit before rising, and we feel a little more depressed or anxious.

Many common antidepressants like the SSRI's don't yield the full psychological benefit until about 4-6 weeks in. They do, however, commonly afford physiological changes as soon as 2 weeks in -such as an increase in energy (less fatigue), and overall willingness to try new things. Well, there's this 2-4 week window between the physiological changes and the psychological ones. The result can sometimes lead to the increased willingness to try new things, but before the increased mood benefits have fully been realized.

So each has to be self-aware of their vulnerabilities and how they match up with the player they're facing.

Conversely, if the hitter isn't a guy who is likely to catch up to a good heater, he needs to know when and where this pitcher might throw a secondary pitch, a change up or type of breaking ball, to have a chance to hit it.", "The batter's base line strategy is to not make an out. Depending on the game situation that can be modified in any number of ways, but the battle between pitcher and batter always remains.

", "This leads to many batters going to the plate looking for \"their pitch.\" Like in the previous example, a batter who isn't adept at hitting A+ fastballs against a power pitcher will go to the plate knowing that in certain pitch counts - let's say with one strike - the pitcher likes to throw a low breaking ball. The batter will key in on that particular pitch and hope that its in a good spot for him as he'll be ready to pounce on it. The batter also knows he's weak at fastballs above the belt so he needs to either be ready to take his best swing at one during the at bat or be OK with letting it go and waiting for a different pitch. Of course with two strikes he's got to be mentally ready for it either way and needs to adjust physically - choking up on the bat, shortening his swinging motion - to have a chance.

Guys are swinging for the fence more than ever before which leads to more home runs and more K's. Advanced metrics and statistics have a lot to do with this. Teams are now building around both guys that hit homers and guys with high OBP (on-base percentage). There's a statistic that quantifies the combination of these two, called OPS (on-base plus slugging). The old standard of batting average is less relevant today. It doesn't matter how often you get on base via a hit, just how often you get on base at all. So basically putting a team together with high OBP/OPS guys results in the most offensive output, because you've got guys getting on base and then guys hitting home runs to drive them in. So, in short, these days at least, it's not totally wrong to say that everybody is swinging for home runs. However, there are still a lot of old school managers and players who haven't bought into this new style yet.

We're seeing a lot more players who are trying to hit the ball into the air with more of an uppercut swing than ever before.  In doing so we have seen the home run numbers increase in recent years.  I can go way more in depth if you please.", "An example of when the batter wouldn't want to swing for the fences is the following scenario. There is a runner on 2nd, the right fielder is playing deep, and your team's goal at the moment is to advance runners. In this situation you would want to hit a base hit to shallow right field. Base hits will land quickly allowing the runner on 2nd to leave his bag without having to wait for the ball to land or be caught. And because it is hit to right field, it will draw the defense away from 3rd base giving the runner on 2nd plenty of time to get to 3rd and round the bag to pressure home. The hope is, with pressure on home, the right fielder in an effort to protect home will wildly fire the ball from right field to the catcher. This throw is risky and often missed. In the event that the ball goes past the catcher the runner on 3rd will charge home plate hoping the catcher doesn't toss the ball to the pitcher running to meet him at home. And as soon as the right fielder fires the ball to home you will take 2nd base. ", "If the defense is good you'll have a runner on 1st and 3rd.

If there are two outs and the batter just puts the ball in play, the defense simply needs to get the batter out at first and the run that scored wouldn't even count. In this situation the batter would be looking for a single or more.", "The pitch style and location sometimes could change the battery's approach as well. If a hard fastball is thrown towards the outside edge of the strike zone, the hitter should definitely try to hit the ball to the opposite field, meaning the side of the field opposite to the batter.

Their swings tend to be shorter and more level and geared toward line drives.

Here are a few examples:", "Some guys will step up to the plate and purposely pop the ball in left field high up knowing it's going to be an out in order for the guy on 3rd base to have enough time to run home and score.

Ok imma go home now...", "Teams that have only home run hitters tend to be one-dimensional and easier to get out, and that's not helpful when you consider that a player that has a .300 batting average (fails to get a hit in 70% of his at bats) is considered good. It makes it easier for pitchers to silence your batting order, and reduce your team's batting average against him to .250 (fail to get a hit in 75% of at bats), .200 (fail to get a hit in 80% of at bats), and even below .200. Over the course of nine innings or more, this becomes very apparent.", "Any one-dimensional batting lineup is bad. With a team completely void of power hitters in a lineup, it's hard to produce runs since you are requiring more hits to produce the same amount of runs that home runs can produce. With a team completely void of players that can safely get on base, every home run that team hits is that much less important, and if the power stroke isn't there or the batters are impatient and refuse to take walks, it becomes that much more easier on the opposing pitcher, since having baserunners on when a power hitter is up to bat is much more threatening than without players on base and the same batter up, or a pitcher is able to safely strike out your big power hitters.", "Additionally, the strongest players can't play every day. Everybody needs days off at some point or another, and guys get injuries in baseball. Teams may also forego offensive presence if certain players' defensive capabilities are subpar.

Early in the at bat, with a favorable count for the batter they may guess fastball and seing for the fences. It's a situation where if you guess wrong, you still have a strike or two to work with. With 2 strikes, it's important to identify the pitch so you make contact. This often results in a shorter, less powerful swing.", "Also outside pitches are easier to hit to the opposite field. While you can hit homeruns that way, it doesn't happen as often as pulling the ball. So you would just try square it up and hit a line drive.", "Basically if you take the wrong seing at a pitch, you won't be successful at all. Hitters are often trying to match the swing to the pitch. This is a lot easier said than done, as the hitter has just a few hundredths of a second to process the pitch and begin a swing.", "A batters job is to hit the ball, there are very few people who can hit a home run 10 out of 10 times, there's even fewer people who can hit a home run 1/10 times against an MLB pitcher. The batters job is to hit the ball, if it is a home run then so be it. At times however it is safer to hit a \"fly ball\" (a high ball that quite frankly is expected to be caught but gives the chance for a runner to go to the next base and maybe score). Sometimes batters are asked to pull the ball or go opposite field which basically happens when there is a weak spot in the defense. So what I'm trying to get to is that a batter never TRIES to hit a home run, they try to hit the ball that's it and sometimes they are given a directed target, but it is definitely nice to get that home run.", "Most of the time, you just want to make contact and drive the ball. Without getting into a physics lesson, a ball moving at 90+mph flies off the bat pretty quickly when hit. And if you look at the sheer size of the outfield of a baseball diamond, that's a lot of area to try and cover. And the ball moving at those speeds makes it difficult to get to the ball sometimes.

Other times its just a hit the ball hard and hope it goes where the other guy is not.

Your approach is to be able make solid contact to all parts of the field on any pitch, and it changes with the situation. Runner on 1st, no outs, you better be trying to hit the ball to the right side of the field, your job is to get the runner over, now if you put one over the right field fence, great, but that's not the job or the approach. There's a reason why some of the greatest hitters in history weren't home run hitters (Ty Cobb, Pete Rose), they consistently made hard contact, put the ball in play, got runners over/in, without ever really needing to hit homeruns.", "Unless you are in a position to guess, a hitter looks for a fastball first and adjusts to other pitches.  The actual mechanics of swinging and seeing the ball are all from memory - no time to think about that.  ", "Elite hitters can see the rotation of the ball and use the input of speed, location and rotation to \"guess\" where the pitch will end up when it reaches home plate.  This phenomenon of \"guessing\" is based on the thousands + repetitions in games and practice.  Interestingly, most hitters will describe hard fastballs as RISING above their bats when that is physically impossible.  The illusion of rising is based on their miscalculating the rate of the ball falling as it makes its way to home plate.", "I'm a college baseball player in the United States. It's much more complicated than just trying to hit a home run. But theoretically yes, you are correct in your statement. Players above the high school level are taught to hit solid line drives depending where the pitch is thrown. For instance, if you are a right handed batter and the pitcher throws it inside, the players are attempting to \"pull\" the ball which means hitting the ball to your side of the batters box. These are the home run balls. If the pitcher throws it outside you attempt to hit the ball opposite way which usually doesn't result in a home run, but either a gapper to the outfield or a line drive to the right fielder. ", "In the early days, folks like Ty Cobb were masters of hitting the ball into the gaps and getting on base. That was the key to the game: hitting the ball to the right spot. Baseball has turned into more of a power game today, but there's still a lot of strategy. You don't just swing at every pitch, you have to calculate your best odds of getting a good hit and make a split second decision on the matter.

This in turn helps you appreciate what a batter is dealing with and what choices a batter has to make. ", "Nobody's mentioned the hit-and-run play. This play is signalled in advance by the manager. The runner on first breaks for second base, as if he was stealing. If the shortstop breaks to cover second base, the batter will try to hit a ground ball through the \"hole\" where the shortstop had been. Or similarly (more often in fact) the second baseman moves to cover second and the batter hits the ball behind the runner. If the pitch is a bad one to hit, the batter just \"takes\" the pitch and it becomes a regular steal play. The advantage of the hit-and-run is that since the runner gets a head start, he can usually make it to third base.", "I used to play baseball in High school and it was my life. I can answer this question. For starters hitting a home run is typically an accident. You never want to swing for the fences on every pitch, that's a good way to strike out of fly out. However there are certain strategies for certain situations. ", "If there's a runner on first base you'll want to hit a line drive to the right side. This makes it so that while the runner is running to second or possibly third base, the right fielder has a longer distance to throw.

If the player only tries to hit a home run and misses, he will strike out.  If he tries to put the ball in play, he might end up with a home run, but he also might get a double or single.  So, trying for home runs is riskier.", "Also, if there are people on base, he wants to hit the ball to certain places on the field where those runners will not get thrown out.

A single on one pitch doesn't necessarily have as much effect as a first out after 15 pitches. ", "No not in most cases. I played baseball for many years and have continued to follow the sport. Most coaches will tell you when swinging the bat to only try to utlize 70-90% of your full power. This prevents you from using poor technique and most often results in a higher rate of contact with the baseball. Not only that but when you're dealing with pitches in the MLB coming in at 90+mph most of the power is generated from the speed of the baseball not the swinging of the bat. The harder you swing the more likely it is you will make an error such as pulling your head away from the baseball on your follow through. If you pull your head away your eyes are going to follow  in the same direction affecting your ability to see the ball. Simply put you can't hit what you can't see. Variables such as strength, bat speed, and god given hand eye coordination also play a big part in this as well.", "It really depends on how the field looks.  Thanks ultimately you want to make contact and keep a good technique.  If you have no one on base, you'd ideally hit a grounder towards 3rd Base that will pop up.

Unfortunately, there's no easy answer, which is why businesses are willing to pay an incredible amount of money just to buy an existing social network. If you've ever wondered why Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are worth so much even though they have no clear business model, this is exactly why (social networks are valuable because they are very difficult to create).", "Nevertheless, here are a few guidelines that can help create a network.

Social apps become more useful when more people sign up, which means the users themselves are interested in helping advertise the app. For example, Venmo isn't very useful if your friends don't use it, so there's already an incentive for you to get your friends to install it. This growth will happen slowly over time, but because a critical mass requires a lot of simultaneous new users, you can speed up the process by rewarding existing users who help you expand your network. Venmo did this with a $20 referral bonus to both the new user and the friend who referred them. Other apps reward in-app currencies or features, such as letting you message more people on dating apps.", "3) Minimize sign up costs for users. If you've ever wondered why many computer games (e.g. League of Legends) and mobile games are free to play, it's because the very presence of a user is valuable.

You know how we said we would pay you? Turns out we can't!\"", "So yeah. A lot of the apps rely on getting some college kids to whore out downloads from their friends.", "I was on Grindr when it first started. On the original iPhone.

They're putting together some good video content and sharing it online.", "It seems like it's a tough grind.", "Actually, I just remembered something.

But if those 50 people were from the same school, they might find it to be useful. And those 50 people would start telling their friends that aren't on facebook to get on facebook. And everybody that signed up would have at least a few people that they could talk to, and they'd start telling their friends to get on facebook. You can see how quickly these numbers can skyrocket.", "You only need a small starting point and a well designed platform for it to blow the fuck up.

You'll see people doing this a lot on reddit, but usually only in the smaller subreddits. Fake user accounts is another option.", "Smaller companies lean heavily on word of mouth.

Target the big cities and college campuses first which tend to set the trends for everyone else. Once some buzz is going in those areas then you expand your marketing to broader markets.", "I was offered a promo job for some dating app a year or so ago. We walked down the line of club liv with 'cool' light up shit that drunk tourists live for. If they downloaded our app, they got a random prize and a voucher for a free drink if one of their friends signed up before they entered the club.  (Drinks at liv are like 30$ so almost everyone did it) imagine them doing this in miami, la, new york, chicago etc on the same night in multiple clubs per city? The tourists go home,  the app alerts them to nearby people and they start using it... they are in those cheezy club photos you take at the entrance with the glasses, boom sticks, pins, phone cases etc with the logo on it. Of course they post that super cool time they went to liv on their social media.... advertising to more people. It was pathetic to watch people give up personal info, effectively selling themselves to advertising companies,  to get a fucking light up ring.  ", "Not a direct answer to the question, but any service that requires a group of users to work relies on \"network effect\". That is, the value of the service is very dependent on having the right number of users in its network. Having too few people on a dating site makes it useless, or in business terms, it has little value. ", "When starting such a service, the cost to acquire each user is an important cost to factor into business plans. ", "Some apps have a 'pre-order' like sign up phase where you create your account before the app actually comes out. That way, when the app launches, it could already have thousands of users, many of which are excited for it to come out and will start eagerly using it from day 1.", "I found Tinders story pretty cool. From what I recall they actually threw a party at USC and had everyone there download the app and it grew at least partially naturally from those people. Pretty sure it was like a couple sororities and frats. Look it up. ", "This is a huge part of what killed Google+.  Google did a slower rollout of Google+ and throttled who was allowed to join.  When interest was highest for Google+ only a small group of people were allowed to join.  Those folks eventually got bored of talking to each other and didn't use Google+ as much.  When Google+ was finally opened up for anyone to join all the early adopters already left due to boredom.", "The slow-rollout approach worked fine for Gmail, because you can still email people on other services.

Tinder actually started by bribing sororities.", "Google+ gave out early access to 30-40 year old male tech bloggers. Guess what happened to them.", "It usually starts with local marketing. I had an idea for an app, and just by taking surveys people wanted to use our app, and kept asking us about it even thought it wasn't economically safe to start that app. Another app has had a history of bulling people out of the market by offering their larger more experienced infrastructure to users.", "So, to answer the question it starts relatively small, but function, unless its comes from an existing company then its the big fish eating the little fish.

What I mean is you can reach out to internet celebrities that already have their own fan base, and ask them (pay them) to use your app and bring their followers with them.

This is often what generates the buzz, so this element is what gets the most attention, as it should, but it doesn't outshine the previous three P's.", "Time, it seems rather obvious but time is literally money. In order to augment all of the P's to work together and start a fire you have to be realistic about what it costs to reach the number of people to drive to a Tipping Point.", "Once you have identified those parameters it's about reaching enough people frequently enough to get them engaged.

Cover charge was free if you showed your phone had the app installed. ", "Pretty sure I heard somewhere that Tinder started with a huge party. To get in, you had to download and use the app before you came (no pun intended)", "Most people left that party pretty happy. ", "I think none of these answers are convincing enough. We know what they did, but not how they did it.", "In my opinion it is solving by solving problems. Facebook, Snapchat, Tinder all solved a problem, which is why their critical mass was that quick to acquire. The beauty lies in finding a user problem the user wants a solution to urgently.

Much of it is data mining your analytics, tweak it until you figure out where acquisition is less than the value of the customer and then start throwing money into that specific strategy.  Having a really good analytics team can help you bring customers into your platform for cheap.", "[removed]", "Some of these apps also started as a different platform entirely. When Instagram first started it was promoted as an image filter app but you were forced to create an account to use their filters. It happened to have a feature that would let you post on Facebook and twitter at the same time in exchange for posting on their social network. So it kind of built up that way.

So I guess through sheer market testing. badoo had location based swiping. then tinder was developed from that. then they monotized swiping amount.
