VMRO is a Russian/Serbian puppet while the opposition party is Soros puppet. On the other hand DUI (ethnic albanian party) is USA/EU puppet.\nAlmost to years ago in the political scene the opposition leader (zaev) published some illegal wiretapping materials done by the Government (he claims it is the Government, Government claims that a secret service of another country has done the wiretapping)\nAfter the wiretapping scandal showed that the Government was implicated in huge criminal, including corruption, election fraud, mounting political trials and controlling the media, the opposition coalition lead by SDSM and backed by some NGOs, stared massive protests, which they named the colorful revolution.\nAfter USA/EU pressure, VMRO had to sit in negotiation table with SDSM and two Albanian parties, which lead to Przino Agreement.\nThis Agreement among other requirements for new elections, included the need of election lists to be cleaned up(due to previous election fraud), free media and the most important the need of extrending the mandate of Special Prosecutor who would be in charge to investigate all the criminal offenses made by the VMRO-DUI Government (based on wiretappings)\nVMRO clearly was not happy with the Agreement.\nAfter the elections, VMRO won 51 of 120 seats in Assembly (11 less than previous term) while SDSM won 49.\nAlbanian parties won 20 seats (10 DUI, 5 Besa, 3 AA and 2 DPA). Since no party could form a solid majority in the Assembly, Albanian parties (excluding DPA) made a statement (some call it a platform) for the basic requirements of those parties to participate in any other coalition with a Macedonian party. Since the Albanians parties didn't agree to seat with each-other to sing that statement, Albanian Prime Minister intervened and invited them in Tirana to sing the statement. \nNow the mess begins.\nJust after the statement was signed, Macedonian President violated the Constitution while giving the mandate to the VMRO (Constitution says to get a mandate, a coalition or party must have over 50%+1 of the seats).\nVMRO was willing to continue governing with DUI, and immediately accepted the statement of Albanian parties but, was not willing to accept the extension of the mandate of Special Prosecutor. And this was the reason, USA/EU secretly asked from Albanian parties not to form a Government with VMRO.\nSDSM supporting the Special Prosecutor had no difficulties to accept the Albanian statement and claimed that have reached an Agreement to coalition with Albanian Parties.\nSince the head of VMRO is facing serious charges from the Special Prosecutor, organised protests against Albanian statement (which they call Albanian Platform).\nAfter securing more than 50%+1 of the seats, the President (VMRO puppet) refused to give the mandate to the opposition leader. After 5 weeks of war of words in the Assembly, SDSM decided to appoint Talat Xhaferi (DUI) as head of the Assembly. Knowing that after appointing head of Assembly, soon would be formed a new Government, the protesters (encouraged by VMRO) entered the Assembly, after the special forces (led by VMRO member Cavkov).

This is what I observed: 1.) woman gets on the plane pushing a car seat type stroller with one child in it, carrying a second child on her hip and dragging behind a very large folded stroller that was too big for the overhead bin or to go under a seat. 2.) the flight attendant shown in the video approached from the back of the plane and informed her in a calm manner that there was nowhere to store the stroller. The woman immediately escalated the situation and within about 30 seconds was screaming at him at the top of her lungs. 3.) the flight attendant evidently decided she was not fit to be on the flight (in my opinion the correct decision) and started to move her and her children towards the front of the plane. 4.) when they got to the from of the plane the woman decided she was not going any further. The flight attendant picked up the stroller and lifted it over his head to try and move past the woman. As he was doing this she pushed him and the stroller fell a bit and struck her in the face. She began crying loudly and dramatically. Shortly after this is where the video begins. 5.) The first class passenger then inserts himself into the drama with his faux chivalry but clearly has no idea what has transpired in the back of the plane since he was in a window seat in the first class section of the plane and could not have viewed the incident from his seat. 6.) after another 10 minutes or so the woman exits the plane only to be returned about 5 minutes later and taken to her seat. We wait another 30-40 minutes while various flight and ground crew come and go speaking to the woman. After about 40 minutes she deplanes again this time telling all of the passengers, who are now becoming vocal in support of the flight crew, that all she wanted was an apology from the flight attendant. Evidently that's what the 40 minute delay was all about. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the ground crew to find and remove her luggage from the belly of the plane. 7.) the flight finally leaves and arrives in Dallas an hour or so late. American representatives are waiting at the gate to speak with the first class passenger who made the threats. What I heard was a very apologetic tone coming from two American employees, as if the airline had done something to upset the first class passenger. 8.) when I entered the bag claim area the first class passenger was right in front of me and as soon as he made it through the revolving door there was a camera crew waiting for him on the other side to interview him. That's about as factual of an account as I can provide and I realize there may be other parts of this story that I do not know about or did not witness. From what I saw: a.) if anyone from American should have been punished it should be the ground crew who somehow letting this woman on board with a full size stroller. The flight attendant was put in a horrible situation by a passenger that most passengers in my immediate area thought seemed unstable. She escalated the situation, not him. b.) in my opinion, the first class passenger should have been removed. Had the flight been in progress he might very well have been arrested upon landing for threatening a crew member. Additionally, he could not have seen any of the back of the plane antics of the woman based on where he was seated. c.) I agree the flight attendant may have reacted too harshly in responding to the threatening customer in first class, but his actions with the woman in question were professional throughout the ordeal. I am disappointed American has chosen to punish him. If this eyewitness source is to be believed (and I don't know about you, I'm trusting the witness more than the lady who is overreacting), the lady clearly got on with a stroller way too big for an overhead or under a seat. The flight attendant calmly informed her that it was too big to fit in the bins. She immediately escalated said situation and stated screaming at this flight attendant. (Overreaction, a little?) The flight attendant decided to kick her off (which I agree with, along with the eyewitness), and started to move them to the front of the plane, where the lady stopped. The flight attendant took the stroller and moved it over his head to get it off of the plane, and this is where the lady pushed him, causing the stroller to hit her lightly in the head. She then proceeded to bawl and cry like a 3 year old. This is where the video/gif starts. The first class passenger decides to fight on her side, with literally no idea of what went down, and this is where the gif explains itself. The lady then proceeds to get back on, and then causes a 1 hour delay, with the entire plane cheering for the flight crew. At landing, there were several American reps to talk to the passenger as if they pissed him off. The rest of that eyewitness account is mostly opinion. And to add insult to injury, the flight attendant was suspended. All over a lady playing obvious victim in order to get a lot of lawsuit money after what happened on United Airlines. I'm not saying the UA disaster was right, it was certainly wrong, but this isn't a disaster, this isn't brutality, this is someone playing victim.

Since I was near the front, I cannot know what happened. If she tried to put the stroller in the overhead bin or what.   The flight attendant told her she could not have the stroller on the plane and he needs to take it.  She refused to let him take it and was to the near point of shouting.   The flight attendant shouted up for security very soon on, escalating the situation more (he should have been working on deescalating)", "The flight attendant and the woman started making their way to the front of the plane (I forgot who had the stroller at this point).  She had her two kids.  She shouted something about being an Argentinian woman and yada yada.   ", "It was this point where things escalated a bit more.  The flight attendant and Argentinian woman were at the front of the plane in the crew area / next to the front door of the plane.   She was hanging onto the stroller and refusing to let go.  The flight attendant was trying to remove it from the plane.  Both were at fault here in my opinion.  The flight attendant's tone was overly aggressive.   The woman was refusing to let it go and made an aggressive move grabbing the flight attendant (which she should not have done)   This angered him and he responded by jerking the stroller harder knocking the Argentinian woman in the head and nearly missing her kids.  The flight attendant should not have been so aggressive and should have been aware of the kids.    ", "The video you see above, and I have a similar video (wish i recorded earlier in the situation), is the aftermath.  A lot of people were upset in how he treated the woman, knocked her, and her having children around.

I was nice to him but you could tell he was worried for his job and could only respond with basic responses.
