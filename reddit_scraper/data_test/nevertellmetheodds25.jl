Most PGA professionals have the same cadence, and besides Tiger and Bubba, most golfballs follow a predictable flight.  Some tricks: if you're doing your own exposure take a sky reading and a green reading so you can roll your iris without thinking.

Also know where the flag/cup is relative to where your camera is on the green, so when the ball lands  and the flag isn't in frame,  you know which direction to pan to include it.  As for tracking the ball, the operator can set his/her viewfinder to however allows them to see the ball better.  Some people use a very high amount of \"peaking\" which makes the ball pop.
