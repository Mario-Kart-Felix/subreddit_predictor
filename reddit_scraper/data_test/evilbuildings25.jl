My one bedroom apartment is worth 2.65 crore rupees, or about four hundred thousand dollars. This figure is mindboggling when you consider that Indians have much less buying power so the only way you can live here is if you are incredibly successful in business, or if you have inherited it. I inherited it. Originally my grandmother bought it in the 60's. When I was a child, we had an offer for 30 lakhs (about $45,000 in today's exchange rate). We were tempted to sell it then and move to a cheaper neighbourhood but didn't.

The 225-ton monument arrived a year earlier in 214 crates as a gift from France. Including her pedestal and foundation, Lady Liberty reaches 305 feet; her index finger measures eight feet long, tipped by a 13-inch fingernail. Designed by French sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi to celebrate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence, the statue's $250,000 tab was covered via donations, a French national lottery and a benefit concert at the Paris Opera, among other things. America, in return, was responsible for the statue's base and pedestal, to be constructed within the existing walls of Fort Wood, an Army post on what was then known as Bedloe's Island. At first, most Americans weren't fans of Lady Liberty; out-of-town newspapers and political leaders scoffed at the idea of backing a \"local\" New York project. Momentum began to shift as Joseph Pulitzer used his ", "\u00a0to talk up the effort, prompting benefit balls, theatrical performances and donations to help finish the $280,000 job. ", "In addition to welcoming millions of immigrants arriving at neighboring Ellis Island (the \"huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\" in the words of Emma Lazarus' poem, itself written as part of a Statue of Liberty fundraiser), the statue had a more immediately practical function: lighthouse. Considered a navigational aid to ships entering the harbor, the statue was first administered by the U.S Lighthouse Board before eventually falling under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. A massive, two-year project restored and improved the statue in time for its 100th birthday in 1986, \nreplacing the torch with one made of copper plated with gold, which is why it doesn't oxidize like the rest of her.", "The monument's designers never intended to have visitors inside, and the hot interior meets no fire codes and offers no emergency exit other than a single steep, vertigo-inducing staircase.  After 9/11, the statue was closed to all tourists.  But in the years since Sept. 11, New York's political leaders pushed relentlessly to open the crown and its 25 windows to the public. \"It probably isn't completely safe to have everyone go up, in any numbers, at any time,\" Rep. Anthony Weiner conceded to the New York\u00a0Times. \"But the Park Service is full of slightly dangerous things you can do.\" The Obama administration agreed.
