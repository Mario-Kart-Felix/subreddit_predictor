What idiot would pitch new investments in an already saturated start up market that is in the midst of major legal battles.

Apple saw the problems that the more \"open\" personal computer platform had with malicious software that could harm someone's machine or compromise their privacy. So in order to maintain control over their platform and ensure the security of their devices they decided to require every app to be downloaded through the App Store. In order for an app to get on the App Store, it would have to fall within certain rules and restrictions set forth by Apple. Apple inspects every app submitted to them before releasing it to the App Store to ensure it meets their requirements.", "While this is fairly restrictive, there's not much uproar from the general public about it because it's just the way things have always been. They've never experienced smartphone apps any other way. Sure, a lot of us technical users may not like it, but it's sure better than having a teenager get stalked because they downloaded a virus to their phone that gave away their location via GPS. So we either deal with it or we jailbreak/root our phones to gain more control over our devices, with the understanding that if something breaks it's our own fault.", "Now both Apple and Microsoft are trying to release app stores on their personal computer platforms. macOS now has its own App Store and Windows 10 has the Windows Store. These stores have many of the same requirements and restrictions as their mobile counterparts. While this may seem good considering all of the safety benefits for non-technical users, it's sort of an attempt to shoehorn a different distribution method into an already established platform. App stores worked on mobile devices because the platform was relatively young and therefore people didn't really have expectations regarding how software would be distributed. But on personal computers, there are already very well-established programs such as Chrome, Firefox, Flash, 7-Zip, Adobe's Creative Suite, etc. that don't meet the requirements to be put in the app store.", "Furthermore, unlike mobile devices, developers use personal computers to develop software and need to be able to access certain things that are normally restricted on mobile devices in able to do so. Apple and Microsoft can't just pull the plug and restrict side-loading applications like they do on mobile. People want to be able to use the programs they already use and developers aren't willing to rewrite their programs and even potentially remove features in order to meet the guidelines of each app store. Even if it would be more secure, they would be receiving complaints from angry users who suddenly aren't able to use their favorite programs anymore.", "So now the personal computer platform is sort of stuck in limbo between the old-fashioned method of downloading software from your browser and running an installer and the \"new\" method of clicking download in an app store and having it install the software for you. While the app stores are present, they don't have the software people want so people don't use them. Since nobody uses them, they don't get improved. It's become cyclical.", "It should be noted that Linux distributions have used package managers which are very similar to app stores and are a very efficient way of distributing and installing software for a while now. Software is downloaded from the distribution's repositories and is installed by the package manager, ensuring security in a similar fashion to app stores in that each program has the \"seal of approval\" from their distribution. Additional benefits include being able to re-use already installed libraries instead of having to include them separately in each individual application which wastes disk space and ease of updating programs since the package manager essentially handles it for you. Just run a command and all of your programs are updated. However, Linux distributions don't place nearly as many restrictions on developers as app stores do. Additionally, most software in the repositories is open source and maintained by the distribution itself rather than the developer of the software.", "I'm not really sure what the solution is. Downloading software through a web browser and running installers is getting extremely outdated and sometimes makes keeping your programs up to date a nightmare.

So much so that each item unlocked, whether good or bad, can be sold again through the marketplace for a second or third cut to Valve. These items could range anywhere from hundreds of dollars to a few cents (I'm British, but just using dollars as the example). Regardless, they get a slice of the same pie, multiple times. This is business, but the morals of such things are nonexistent. First exploit people and then take money from multiple people potentially an unlimited amount of times. Of course in reality this doesn't happen, but given the sheer number of CSGO players,   it all adds up to a tasty sum.
