Good job. ;)", "I used to work at a store near the Canadian Border and all the Asians that came down from Canada tried to pretend they didn't speak English to get better deals(change a price on floor, then insist on the price and pretend they don't understand) until they find out the random white boy working in the shoe store speaks Mandarin, and understood them the whole time!", "I also had a customer once who was super impressed because while I was helping her, a Mexican woman asked me a question but spoke basically no English at all, so I instinctually just switched into Spanish and continued helping her. Around this time a Chinese lady(who spoke English and Chinese) gets in line behind the first customer and while the first lady was telling how cool she though it was that I was bilingual, I go \"oh yea? Watch this!\" And leaned towards the Chinese lady and told her I'd be with her in just a second in Mandarin. I thought the original customers head was gonna explode!

You would talk to him and he would say no english. Up until You gave him the price. \"What 120 bloody, what a bloody rip off.
