Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons. With a few incantations, they could manipulate the water, the earth, even the air that we breathed. But they could not touch fire. So we gave them what they wanted. Napalm, incendiary bombs, hellfire missiles. They wanted our fire so bad? I hoped they like our gifts.", "Things were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge. Then came the Earth-Takers.

The tides are unchanging and the trees do not grow. The people of this universe know not the meaning of barriers, as they pass through solid matter as easily as a man falling through a gust of wind: all is dense and hot and unfeeling, with nothing to stretch the space from the earth to the sky. Living things burrow deep into the rich soil and stay there for many years.", "The kingdom without Fire is a space without light. There is water to drink and dirt to walk upon, but no stars to shine above or warm hearths waiting below. The quiet, velvet darkness of the void reigns over every world within it. They have learned to communicate in whispers and hands; long, pale fingers caressing the paths before them, sightless eyes that never blink.", "The absence of Water in the fourth realm is a strange emptiness, as well. The air crackles with electricity and the acrid scent of ozone never leaves. Most beings are flat and dark, moving across the cracked surfaces of planets like shadows. They feed off sunlight and warmth and little else, moving slowly throughout the day with the many suns in their skies.", "Most curious of all is the universe without magic. So many world exist with elements in abundance: entire planets of liquid and ice, enough sunlight to feed thousands of shadows, and yet they remain barren. No one walks the spaces between them. However, every now and then, life will begin on a planet despite lacking the spark of magic, purely due to the four remaining elements existing in harmony. Enough Water to create clouds in the air, enough Earth to receive the rain. Enough Fire to light the way, and enough Air to freely move. ", "The creatures here create magic for themselves, by harnessing the existing energies and creating more of their own. Strange beings of iron and steel that glide across surfaces faster than any animal. Metal contraptions that move mountains and dig caverns.

Harnessing the energy of the Earth, funneled through the Grand Magis, we collided two heavy particles of lead. Our theory was the destruction of the particles we create a void in our universe that would force a tear into another and create a channel for mass to flow from one into the other. We tried for years with lighter particles, but they broke and scattered before any channel could be made. As I calculated, lead would have a high probability of success. ", "On April 25th, 2025, the Grand Magis were summoned to the Brediok Particle Collider in Brediok, Naster. Perched atop the volcano of Naster, the Magis drew the power from the Earth. Life was born from the fires of the Earth. We grew from the flames. It only seems appropriate that our meddling with the ways of life created our downfall. ", "The Grand Magis came to the mountaintop in their silken gowns. They were bright purple against the colourless sky. Their hands of silicon and carbon poked out and veils of fire that brought their bodies to life began to brighten. The volcano rumbled to their chanting as the two particles of lead drifted above our heads. It was beautiful. ", "The group of Magis danced back and forth, using their craft to accelerate the particles faster and faster. Like two tectonic plates tangoing they heaved and bashed until at last their hands met in the center and the particles collided. ", "In a blinding flash, the particles met and the sky twisted. There were no sounds, just the rupturing of infinite universes trying to find balance. Then, a liquid began to pour. Not like lava, or the blood in our veins, but soft and cooling. First, it trickled and then it gushed. It spread across the volcano, killing the Magis, then spilled over the edge of the volcano. It spread into the valleys and didn't stop until our world was separated by this blue, clear liquid. ", "The liquid has stopped pouring, but the damage remains. We agreed to call it water, for it seemed to be a name that sprung to all our minds. Now the sky is blue and our planet is covered in this lethal substance.

She touches Michelle on the arm in the train station -- deserted as always at 4 in the morning -- and smiles lightly. Giant, colorful wings bounce behind her. Even next to the deep hue of Michelle\u2019s own skin, this woman seems impossibly dark. \u201cHello!\u201d she chimes, in a voice soft and low, and strangely musical. \u201cI\u2019ve come from another world, and your world is very strange.

Some bullshit about all five of our Earths occupying the same exact space in each of our respective universes so that the concentric gravitational pulls opened some kind of wormhole.

It didn't take long for everything to fall apart, though.", "Those of us on Earth Prime can't even exist peacefully with ourselves, much less with FOUR other Earths full of people with the same exact problem.

Antarctica, shattered.  Australia, ravaged.  Southern Africa and much of South America, obliterated.

It turns out, that was true in this case, too.", "The other Earths don't have science, because magic is natural on their planets.

Everyone in the room knew this.", "I thought a little about how misleading calling the elements earth, water, fire and air were. For any one thing, exactly one of the five universes was missing it. Each of the 4 elements besides magic stood for one state of matter; earth was solid, water was liquid, air was gas, fire was plasma. Fire also meant energy. Going into a universe where we couldn't stand, couldn't drink or couldn't breathe was unfeasible, so we had to start with the other one.", "I felt a little pang of regret, of course. We had developed this portal machine for reasons that were not exactly moral. We wanted to invade each universe and plunder them. Actually, I didn't want to harm the universes; the people who commissioned me to work on this did. Oh well. People were marching into the portal in their spacesuits already to invade the universe without fire.

Of course we had to go talk to it.", "I'm kidding, of course. One of us provoked it by throwing a spear at it. It bounced off with a clink. The humanoid slowly turned its gaze to us.", "\"Is it a war you want, fools? I know it is. You should have known that nothing in this universe can harm us.

Then there was a Something.\u00a0 This Something was a great being, made of five elements, swirling into a colossal form that sparkled like a star, flowed like a river, swirled like the wind, moved like a boulder and it's mind was pure magic.\u00a0 But no matter how beautiful this Something was, it was alone.", "The Something was so very lonely that it took parts of itself and began creating, for it was better to be smaller with something else to share it with. ", "The first thing it made was a ball of earth, with water to bind it, and warmed by fire, and some magic so it could talk with the Something. They spent many long conversations discussing where they came from. ", "The second thing it made was a nebulous cloud of steam, heated by flame, and of course, a sparkle of magic so it could talk. It loved to talk about why they were here, and their place in the universe.", "The third thing it made was dense and rocky and scorched by fire that raced around it, with gusts of wind to keep its blazing furnace skin alight. Again, it had a coating of magic so they could discuss what they could achieve together.", "The fourth thing it made was a great maelstrom of freezing dirt and air whirling round and round.\u00a0 By the time it came to give this thing magic the Something realised this was the last magic it had to give. It had kept back a little of everything else to ensure it could keep working, but it had enjoyed the conversation so much it had forgotten to save some magic.\u00a0 As the Something gave its last little piece of magic, it curled up into a tight ball in between its new friends and fell very quiet for a long long time.\u00a0 This fourth promised to protect the Something from all harm, for giving it life.", "While the Something may have been only earth, air, water and fire, it began to blossom and grow. Those questions it had asked, and the conversations enjoyed with its friends had woken something in its very skin, which called itself humanity. This humanity grew and questioned and gazed up at the sky where the four friends lived and in time called them planets.", "The initial plans called for a phalanx of special forces to accompany Jamie \u2013 two to flank his side, another forty-eight to encircle the sprawling mansion in the upperclass suburbs, all with strict orders to contain any disturbance with extreme prejudice.

An arresting fountain took centre-stage in the hall, bubbling as the water jets twirled and spun gracefully in the air. Two double-storey waterfalls, cleverly-designed waterspouts from on high, gushed into swirling pools. Streams of water, chugging along inset rivulets, ran across the length of the floor.", "Lwellyn snapped her fingers, and suddenly, all the water ceased. They did not stop, in the way that one may expect if a tap were turned off. Rather, all the water froze where they were, transfixed in motion, as if it were all a streaming video which was in the midst of buffering.", "Lwellyn saw the look in Jamie\u2019s eyes, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here ten years, Jamie, and still I cannot believe your Homeworld takes for granted what we struggle so hard to replace. So forgive me my indulgences.\u201d", "\u201cOh no, I suppose I would have done the same thing,\u201d said Jamie, a wistful edge to his tone, \u201cEvery inch of my home would be filled with every trinket, vessel or embodiment of Magic I could lay my hands on. I understand the allure of what we do not have, Lwellyn, very well.\u201d", "It was somewhat ironic that even though Jamie was the leader of the global think-tank which specialized in advising world governments on trans-world relations, he had never personally crossed over into any of the other Homeworlds. He was intimately aware that crossing over was safe, that one only had to prepare the necessary substitutes \u2013 for example, Lwellyn\u2019s Homeworld, Dessicae, possessed the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Magic in abundance, but Water was notably absent, so that had to be brought along.", "Early forays had determined that it was Magic which had, in a sense, adapted to help Dessicae survive despite the absence of Water. Magic was intangible, omnipotent, and it flowed so richly in Dessicae that it filled in all the roles which Water would normally have played on Jamie\u2019s Homeworld. Subsequent reports confirmed that it was the same on the other Homeworlds \u2013 regardless of which element was missing on that Homeworld, Magic was the glue which bound them all together.", "It was only on Jamie\u2019s Homeworld, where Earth, Air, Fire and Water were all present and accounted for, that Magic had, perhaps deciding that it had no role to play, slinked away.", "\u201cThis cannot be a courtesy call,\u201d said Lwellyn, eyes narrowing, \u201cI am indebted to you, but not once since you took me in as a refugee have you ever called on me in a personal capacity. It has always been about work, and this cannot be different.\u201d", "\u201cYou are astute, and I shall be blunt then. I\u2019ve come to ask for you to unlock the Portal to your Homeworld.\u201d", "Jamie\u2019s request hung in the air, and eventually Lwellyn laughed. \u201cYou must be joking. How do you expect me to be able to do tha-\u201d", "\u201cWe will inform Dessicae that we have finally hunted you down, rooted you out from your hiding place amongst our populace. You will return a political prisoner, but our operatives will be in place to spring you out. We just need you, as a native, to weave the spells needed to fully open the Portal to Dessicae. Once that is done, your debt is clear, and you can return here to live out the rest of your life in peace.\u201d ", "\u201cAnd why the hell would I do that?\u201d", "Jamie had anticipated this question. He had two answers prepared, the first being an appeal to logic. He would show Lwellyn the collected data, that the four elements in Jamie\u2019s Homeworld were irreversibly poisoned, and that open channels were needed to the other Homeworlds so that the tainted elements could be replaced. Negotiations for peaceful acquisition of resources were stalling, and time was running out.", "From that perspective, the problem was suddenly a matter of national, nay, global security.", "And to round off the logical explanation, Jamie would have pointed out that when it came down to a matter of global security, a certain amount of force was allowed, and the opening of the Portals was the first step to a policy they had termed \u201cEnforced Survival\u201d.", "But Lwellyn was not susceptible to logical arguments, as Jamie\u2019s memory served him, so instead he said, \u201cWe have reason to believe your daughter is alive in Dessicae. These photographs were taken just last month. You won\u2019t just be helping your adopted Homeworld survive, you will be bringing your daughter home.\u201d", "Jamie\u2019s hands were already on his vest, and his personal Barrier was activated mere seconds before Lwellyn\u2019s psychic scream tore through the mansion. Part guilt for abandoning the child she thought had died all those years ago, part anguish for not doing more, part shame for moving on when her own flesh and blood still suffered in Dessicae, the Magic spilled out of Lwellyn, a malevolent manifestation of her pain.", "Outside, a hundred feet away, the special agent crumpled to his knees, grabbing his head in pain. The hidden gears and circuits in Jamie\u2019s vest toiled on, shielding him more than adequately.

Tel'na grabbed his bluish grey hand and inserted herself into the crowd. \nAs her eyes scanned the creatures around her, she remembered her father's lessons. \nThere were pairs of fish people from Pessym walking around in their coats of water held together by magic. Their world lacking any earth to walk on, they looked quite awkward as they slithered on sand and stone. The beasts from Nokris seemed more at ease with their long limbs covered in thick black fur. But when he noticed them, Gar'ek whined in fear as their faces lacked eyes. Their world had no fire or light and so those would have been useless to them.", "Tel'na turned away from them and ended face to face with a cloud of red and purple energy. She frose and the living cloud just went through her like she wasn't there. She felt tiny sparks jump all over hher dense body and fell backwards. She was starting to gather her thoughts on the ground when she felt hands pick her up and put her gently back on her feet.", "\"Watch your step missy. These guys from Luzz are so used to their airless void that we barely register to them. And they pack quite a punch.\"\n\"Sorry I guess I wasn't paying attention. Thank you.\"\n\"Don't mention it. Want me to take you back to your mates?\" This being was probably a human from Terra although it was hard to tell what he looked like under the heavy protection he wore to guard himself against Mol'nt's burning sun and dry air.\n\"No it's alright. I'm taking a tour wit my b...\" Tel'na turned her head but all she could see around her were colorful strangers. Gar'ek was nowhere to be found.", "\"Oh no... Gar'ek ! Gar'ek where are you?\", she yelled bursting through the humans in front of her. She started running randomly, calling out to her lost brother. ", "After a while she had to catch her breath and she stopped near the center of the plazza. She inhaled deeply, feeling a deep anguish building inside her. ", "And then she saw him. He was right in front the portal to Terra, just standing there.", "\"Gar'ek stay there! Don't move!\", she yelled.", "Her brother waved at her cheerfully and then jumped through the portal.", "I suppose it was only natural that one day they would open a portal. They had such high hopes for us: this young world, so childishly ignorant of magic, so much to teach. But as always, curiosity was about to burn the cat to its singed bones.\nWe found the portal. It wasn't too hard. Then we poured through, ranks upon ranks. We bore our flickering standard way up high, drowning the land in splashes of yellow and orange and crimson. And then more crimson.\nThey waved their hands, crafted the strangest of the ancient, uttered every word of power they knew, and though they did die, their forces warped and destroyed many. But no spectral bars could cage the beast. A single prick from its many tongues shriveled the body and soul like aeons had passed, as they withered black, and the evil contagion erupted through the dead matter, spreading.\nIf only they had known about water . . .", "The Girl awoke in a different place, just like the Witch had, many years earlier. But while the Girl came from the magicless world, Kan-Sas, the Witch had come from the waterless place, what the locals called The Deadly Deserts. ", "Now, of course, both were in Oz, the fireless. Yes, the Wizard had brought fire from Kan-Sas, and done his best to replicate it, but his substitute was nothing like Kan-Sas or The Deadly Deserts had. And, of course, the Witch was rapidly creating her own fire substitute, threatening all of Oz. And, as a member of The Five, a secret group, with one member from each universe, it was truly in the Good Witch's best interest to keep both the Witch and The Wizard from getting any closer to fire.", "That's where the Girl, Dorothy, came in. The Witch, Elphaba, would be the easy part. When water so much as touched Desertians, they died. The Good Witch, Glinda, wasn't sure of the physics of it, but she knew it was true. Just get the Girl to throw some water on poor Elphie, and that was that. Of course, Glinda couldn't be present for that, it would hurt her so to see her old friend murdered.", "The Wizard would be the challenge. Once a member of The Five, he had gone rogue, learning to control magic as well as his four elements. Practically invulnerable. The only way Glinda could think of was to get him back to his own universe. And she could use the girl as an excuse for him to need to leave! Brilliant! The plan was coming together.", "Glinda hopped into her bubble and smiled. She was ready to go save Oz.", "I'm very late to this party, but the prompt really stuck in my head. I'll post an epilogue as a reply to this.", "I know how to return to my realm, and it saddens me. The knowledge fills my mind as I draw it from the aether around me. With a thought, I conjure a notebook, much like the diary I lost in an endless, waterless desolation so many months ago. This realm has no earth, and thus no trees to produce paper, but I now understand how to coax the aether into creating nearly anything I desire. My thoughts transform into strokes of an invisible pen, and my new knowledge takes form as a set of instructions. As soon as I release my summoning, the new knowledge vanishes from my mind. Thankfully, my newly produced notebook holds the secrets I need to leave this realm.", "I stand on a cloud, suspended above an endless sea. Odd forms swim in the water \u2013 one\u2019s eye must be keen to distinguish the dark blue shapes flitting just under the surface. Beings of liquid, perfectly at home in an ocean with no shores.", "Above me are more clouds, drifting lazily along, following the currents of the endless stratosphere. A cloud shaped like a stalactite dominates the view before me, hanging so that its tip is mere feet over the surface of the water. Like an inverted iceberg, the cloud expands upward, becoming so wide at its top that it blocks much of the afternoon sun.", "I draw aether from the air around me. This is the act I will truly miss \u2013 I have only just gained the ability to weave aether for myself, and I will soon give it up. My body grows lighter, and I float to the stalactite cloud. I am determined to see its residents one more time before I weave my way out of this realm.", "As I approach the hanging cloud, I weave aether around my eyes. The cloud takes on subtleties invisible to the human eye. It now resembles an inverted, snow-peaked mountain with many small caves set at regular intervals. Grey bird-like forms fly between caves, and I direct my flight toward the nearest of those black openings. Just as I float to the mouth of the cave, one small bird-form flies before my face, a gust of playful wind accompanying its curiosity. I stop my approach, pocketing my notebook and floating in place as I address the creature.", "\u201cHello, being of air,\u201d I say, \u201cI am ever thankful to your kind. You taught me how to weave my own spells.\u201d", "\u201cStranger?\u201d I cannot actually hear this reply. I cannot even see the being that well, even though it is right before my eyes. It is a subtle thing, a kind of darker, grey air in a shape that suggests ", " in my mind \u2013 I\u2019ve come to call them ", ". Its voice carries though the aether in a way that even an untrained mind can interpret. ", "\u201cNot a stranger. A friend. Are there none who tell of our first meeting now?\u201d", "The airbird zips into its cave. When it returns seconds later, it is accompanied by several more gray shapes. Even more of the beings flutter out of caves in the background. Tiny wisps raise the hairs on my arms as some beings take flight toward me, whipping around me in curious exploration.", "\u201cHuman?\u201d The question comes from many voices echoing in the back of my mind.", "\u201cYes, I am human. I told you once \u2013 I am from a realm with no aether.\u201d", "\u201cAncestor story. Many generations.\u201d", "I nodded. This is the difficulty in speaking with the creatures. They live only a week at best. I learned aether-weaving over many generations by their reckoning, and had spent even longer preparing to open the way home. ", "\u201cI will return home. You\u2019ve done so much for me \u2013 are you certain I cannot return the favor?\u201d", "The airbird directly before me flutters, and I understand it is considering the offer.", "\u201cMore humans. More friends.\u201d", "I smile as I understand. There do not seem to be other beings capable of thought in this realm \u2013 of course the airbirds want to meet other people.", "\u201cVery well. Let me see if it is possible.\u201d", "I am frightened for a minute. I do not know how I first fell through the opening between realms. I simply awoke in a stony desert, and was forced to search frantically for water. I found no beings in that realm, just endless heat and a sense that I now recognize as the subtle influence of aether in my mind. By pure chance, I stumbled upon a rift in the air, a shimmering portal between realms, and came here to a realm without stone or earth.", "With the airbirds still fluttering around me, I look to the aether again for answers. Part of my mind is still working to keep me afloat as the rest works to understand one final question. I take out my notebook, and once again the answer appears in conjured ink upon a conjured page.", "\u201cI think this is an answer,\u201d I say at last. I look at the page as I come out of my communion with the aether. It is a long mathematical equation, the likes of which are far beyond my rudimentary knowledge. \u201cPerhaps your children will see my kind again.\u201d", "\u201cGo then. Go peacefully.\u201d", "I smile as a tear wells in the corner of my eye. I resolve myself \u2013 as wondrous as this aether is, no such power could equal the company of my own kind. With a final nod to the incredible beings of air, I weave the spell to take me home.", "Lindsay drifted along an icy asteroid belt trying to remember the words to a song the Comms Major played for her last week. She pressed the uplink button on her space helmet and, seconds later, heard the familiar voice of the Comms Major come crackling in through the intercom.", "\"What can I do for you, Lynn?\" said the Comms Major.", "\"Remember that tune you played for me last week?\"", "\"Which?\"", "\"That last one. With the flute coda. Who sings on that one?\"", "\"Oh. Mrs. Susanne Bierman. Sounds kinda throaty. She graduated from the Grigiis Conservatory, on that funky disk.\"", "Yes, the Grigiis Conservatory, established on the edge of a whirring nebular disk by a sorcerer named Grigiis Nephelym, shaper of elements. The academy amassed a lofty reputation not only for its output of piping opera singers, but as an architectural and magical marvel. The school clings to the edge of the nebular disk by an exotic force of magic not entirely understood by anyone outside Nephelym's narrow network of collaborators, careening through the galaxy at unimaginable velocities. Bierman graduated from the academy to a career in jazz singing.", "\"Bierman.\" said Lindsay. \"How'd that song go?\"", "Sang the Comms Major: \"'If only I had a rock to hold me in place, to carry my rivers on its back, to fuel my flame and breathe, breathe into my heart. A rock to call my home.\"", "\"Yes. I like that one.\"", "\"It's a favorite of mine.\"", "They paused, each imagining the next few verses.", "\"Do you think we'll ever find one?\"", "\"What?\"", "\"An Earth.\"", "\"No. We're in the not-Earth universe. Remember?\"", "\"Oh, right.\" Lindsay said. \"We got the magic, water, air, and fire universe! Who gives a FUCK about having some gay Earth? Ha!\"", "Then she queefed out a magic lightning bolt.", "THE END", "Mage Fire", "Dr. Park climbed out from the exposed roots of the tree. The path through the roots had been dark and he didn\u2019t trust electronics on this trip so he walked by the light of a lantern. Just like back at home the massive roots bisected a cave system which seemed odd to Dr. Park since that meant the roots where growing through rock deep into the ground. ", "He held his gloved hand to the wall and started walking, it was a trick he learned from one of the spelunkers when they were initially exploring the caves. He sighed, it would be nice to have one of the guys with him now, but that couldn\u2019t happen since the sorcerer closed off the cave entrance home.", "David focus, I need to get out of this cave, no use dwelling on the past. Dr. Park took a deep breath and kept walking. Ugh, I wish I had my phone, at least I could listen to some music to pass the time.", "The cave was smaller than he expected and it opened up into a normal looking forest. He had been searching for what made this world unique since the other two worlds they had visited had been unusual. Nothing stood out until he had exited the forest onto some farmland.", "Now he could see the setting sun clearly and for whatever reason it was decidedly purple. I\u2019ll have to keep an eye out tomorrow, maybe it\u2019s just the light interacting with something in the atmosphere.", "He sat down and finished the last of his rations, hopefully the farmland meant that there would be a barn nearby he could crash in for the night. He didn\u2019t want to spend the night outside in a strange world. Well no time to waste. He got back up and relit his lantern now that it was twilight.", "He was right! There was a barn! Adjacent to it was a farmhouse. There where blue white flickering lights inside which struck Dr. Park as unusual. He wasn\u2019t that far when he heard yelling. ", "The back door to the farmhouse slammed open and a number of large men dragged a man, a woman, and two children all gagged and bound into the barn. He could hear their muffled cries.", "\u201cOh no,\u201d Dr. Park said under his breath as he stopped in his tracks. I should avoid that, but I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t try to save them. He mulled over that thought for a moment. There\u2019s nothing I can do, I am perfectly justified in not getting myself involved. No one even has to know that\u2026", "A scream from the barn pierced his thought. Dr. Park let out a defeated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m going to die here,\u201d he said.", "He ran to the barn hoping he wasn\u2019t too late. The thugs had left the door open and Dr. Park took a peek inside. Four posts had been planted, each with someone bound to it. There were five men, four thugs and a well dressed man. The well dressed man was addressing the man who Dr. Park assumed was the father. He couldn\u2019t understand the language but when the well dressed man rubbed his thumb against his first two fingers the message seemed to be clear.", "An order was barked and a thug dumped a pile of hay at the base of the posts. Another thug held a lit torch. There it was! The aberration! If this world fit the pattern of the others then that meant this world lacked fire! They used magic to fill in that gap! Ok David, save farmers, don\u2019t die, get a sample of mage fire, move on. I can do this!", "The thug with the torch tossed it into the hay. David froze. It was too late, it was a bad idea to come here, what was he thinking? The mage fire stayed attached to the torch and didn\u2019t spread. David\u2019s brow furrowed as he tilted his head. That\u2019s not right.", "The thug showed his palm to the torch and spoke one word. The mage fire spread to the hay. The farm family cried out and struggled in vain with their bonds. The fire crackled and raced up the posts and onto clothes.", "\u201cNo!\u201d David cried reflexively reaching out.", "The air distorted and the mage fire blew out.", "David, stunned, didn\u2019t move as he tried to process what had just happened.", "The thugs turned towards David. He didn\u2019t remember what happened next, all he knew was he panicked and smashed his lantern onto the thug that attacked him first. He sat on the ground watching as orange flame covered the screaming thug who ran around like a cat chasing a laser.", "Rolling on the ground didn\u2019t seem to occur to the thug who opted to jump into a nearby cart full of hay. What? Is this guy an idiot?", "The well dressed man had been watching this too and for a moment there eyes met. The well dressed man barked some orders crying out \u201cMagi, Magi!\u201d and then they were gone. The thugs just left. Their partner unmoving in the cart and still on fire.", "Besides the crackling of the fire and the night breeze it was quiet. Then the farmers started making noise again. David\u2019s mind started back up, he got off the ground and unbound the family. He had no idea what they were saying but from their tone gratitude seemed to be the message.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dr. Park said.", "One of the children, a teenager, pointed over to the fire, \u201cWosh!\u201d", "\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fire. Here let me show you,\u201d he said. He grabbed the flint and steel from his bag and some hay. He struck some nice sparks starting a small fire. They all looked amazed. The youngest reached out to touch it but David loudly objected. Startled she jerked her hand back but not before the air distorted and the fire blew out. David raised his eyebrows, he would have to remember that.", "The father pulled out his own flint and steel, and gathered his own hay pile. Dr. Park noticed the sparks where that same blue white color of the mage fire. Indeed the hay lit into mage fire. The father promptly stuck his hand in. He picked up the hay and handed it to David who tentatively accepted it. It was warm, gave off plenty of light and didn\u2019t burn him or the hay. It stayed on the hay as he tossed it between hands. ", "They spent the next hour teaching each other about fire and magic, well as well as they could without speaking. The father was more than happy to trade flint and steel with David, especially after he helped them put out the thug and bury him. He stayed the night in the barn and before he left they said some goodbyes. The mother gave him some food, water, and a new lamp to take with him. ", "The trip back through the woods was shorter now that he was more confidant of the way and there was proper sunlight to guide him. While it was just as bad here to look directly at the sun David could tell it was a blue white color.", "Ok, I have mage fire now, good. Just need to get the magic of the other three worlds and I\u2019ll be ready I think.

If you liked this, the others might be interesting too.  Enjoy!", "\"Gentlemen, gentlemen.  Come on in!\"  Jasper Johnson said with a wide smile as he waved the six suited men into his small Bonita Springs condo.  ", "The condo overlooked the gulf.  Jasper and his wife had retired there.  She passed right after his eighty-third, and his children and grandchildren rarely make the trek to visit.  They lived out on the west coast, with all of those hippies, as Jasper called them. ", "\"Take a seat,\" Jasper said.  And the men took their usual seats around his couch.  He always put out two folding chairs beside the couch.  So four very stiff mystery men had to cram shoulder to shoulder on a floral pattern couch, guarded in plastic.  Jasper had hated the couch since his wife picked it out, but he couldn't bring himself to replace it.  He couldn't replace anything since she passed.  Set in his ways, he told himself.         ", "\"So,\" Jasper said as he rolled his wheel chair over, settling opposite the coffee table.  \"How's life, boys?\"", "The suited man in the middle who called himself John was the one that spoke.  ", "Jasper had been living alone for five years after his wife, when one Saturday, for no reason at all, some very nice young men (dressed the way men should be dressed, not in some casual denim -- Jasper hated denim and any man who wore it) showed up at his door.  They said they were with the government, and were doing a survey.", "\"Do you have a moment to answer some questions?\" John had asked on that day two years ago.  ", "Jasper had looked the men up and down, liked the cut of their jib, and grinned.  \"Of course.  I'm just watching the history channel.  But I can pause it.  You know you can pause TV now.  Damnedest thing.  My son tried to show me how to record it and watch it later, but I don't have the patience for all these new age gadgets.\"", "So they spoke that day, and to Jasper's surprise it became routine.  Every Saturday.  At noon.  Like clockwork.  He never put much thought to it, he was pleased to have the company of men that valued the opinion of an experienced old man such as himself.  Nobody respects their elders anymore, Jasper always told anyone who would listen.    ", "\"So, boys, did I ever tell you about Korea?\"  Jasper asked.  ", "\"Yessir,\" John said.  \"And we admire your amazing heroism, sir.  A true patriot.  Right boys.\"", "\"Yes, yes,\" one of the suits said.  \"Balls of steel.\"  Another said.  \"Don't make 'em like you anymore.\"  Another.", "\"No they don't!\"  Jasper laughed.  \"All these kids with their phones and girls doing this twerk thing,\" Jasper dismissed the thought with a flick of his hand.  \"Pah!\"", "\"Jasper we want to speak with you about something very important today.\"", "\"Of course, of course.\"  ", "\"Yes.  Well, ever since Donald Trump was elected --\"", "\"--Ah!  Didn't I tell you boys he'd win.  Can't have a woman president.  A crook none the less.  Need a man with balls and business savvy.\"", "\"Yes, yes.\"  John said.  \"Well there has been a large group of people protesting.  What are your thoughts on them?\"", "\"They're fools!  All of them.  Don't get me wrong, I fought and lost my right foot for this country -- stepped on one of those gooks land mines, I've told you that right? Ah, of course.  Where was I?  Right.  I did what I did for the rights of all the people -- even if they are weak idiots.  They can protest if they want, but they don't know how good they got it.  I'd like to see those pansies go live in China, or send all those pro-life women to Saudi Arabi, let them see how good they actually have it here.\"", "One of the agents, who had taken out a pen and pad and been writing since the start of the session, stopped writing and looked up.

Rally up the hippies and send them to China?\"", "\"Yes.  And the women to Saudi Arabia?\"", "Jasper thought about this.  He rolled his head and made a tsk noise.  \"They should have that done, they deserve it, but -- but I'd be damned to see American's -- any American's suffer at the hands of some foreign commies.  No, for now they can voice their moronic opinions.  It's their right, I suppose,\" he huffed.", "The agent taking notes made a quiet sigh of relief and put a thick line through the last sentence he had written.    ", "\"Agreed.  Good point Jasper,\" John said.  \"How do feel President Trump is doing?\"", "\"Off to a rough start, but people need to give him a shot.  I mean they gave that black guy eight years!

They're racist.\"  ", "The man with a pad wrote -- TRUMP LIVES.", "\"Now, Jasper, we know you fought in Korea, so this might be tough issue for you.\"", "\"I know what you're gonna ask now,\" Jasper laughed.  \"That pudgy little fuck that's running that human slave organization of a country.\"", "\"Yes.  Tensions have been high.\"", "\"I'd say nuke the gooks,\" Jasper started and faded off.", "All the men were on edge.  The pen on the pad was pushed through to the next page.", "\"But, you can't do that.  All those innocent people living there, they got no idea what to do.  They're stuck.\"", "The suited men took a breath again.  ", "\"No,\" Jasper licked his lips and pushed the white stuff from the corners of his mouth.  \"I say put some boots on the ground -- reinforce the DMZ -- send warships, tell China and Japan to play nice and have our backs, or else.  And then launch a tactical strike -- with all those drones they have now -- and take out the North's supply chains, bases, Captain building, everything  to disrupt their government and military.  At the same time send in the SEALs, like they did with Bin Laden, sweep up that fat fuck from whatever hole he's in, put a bullet in his eye, and then tell the North that a new government will be instated.  If they resist, we send in the troops, like a classic game of risk -- if we have China's support -- which we will, it'll be easy.\"", "The man with the pen was writing furiously.  ", "\"What if China doesn't support the cause?\"", "\"They will,\" Jasper nodded.  \"Trump and their President got along.  I saw it on the TV.  They'll help.\"  ", "\"Okay,\" John took a long inhale.  \"Just one more issue we'd like to survey you on today Jasper.\"", "Jasper grinned ear to ear.  \"Shoot.\"", "\"How do you feel about a persons digital privacy rights?\"", "\"Digital privacy?\"  Jasper coughed.  \"Hmm.\"  He tried to think what it meant.  John picked up on this and stepped in to clarify.", "\"For example, a lot of people feel if they search for something on the internet, that should be private information.\"", "\"Oh --\" Jasper leaned forward.  \"Oh, I know what you're talking about.  You know, I don't use the internet, but if I did, I'd have nothing to hide.\"", "\"I see,\" John said.", "\"See all these kids are looking at porn, or sending nudity photographs to their friends -- idiots! -- I saw one thing on the news about a young girl that was raped and her friends filmed it and put it up on the net.  Did you hear about that?\"", "\"I don't recall,\" John said.", "\"Terrible story.  Beautiful young girl too.  Bunch of animals, what they did.  No, if someone does something on the net, it should be watched.  And why not, if you go to a library, they keep a record of the books you take out!  Kids go online and become terrorists -- like those Boston boys!  Got all that foreign crap shoved in their heads and they went all crazy.  Maybe if they were being watched that wouldn't have happened.\"", "\"I see,\" John said as he looked to his note taker, who was flipping to a new page.  ", "\"Well, Jasper,\" John stood up.  \"Looks like that's all this week.\"  The other men stood and made way to the door, filing out neatly.", "Jasper wheeled behind them.  \"So, see you boys next week?\"  Jasper said eagerly.  ", "\"Yes,\" John said and turned to leave, stopped and looked back.  \"Jasper did you have a birthday recently?\"", "\"I did,\" Jasper smiled.  \"The big nine zero.\"  ", "John nodded.", "\"That doesn't put me out of age, for this survey business does it?\"  Jasper said with a worry in his voice.  These visits had become the highlight of his week.", "\"No,\" John smiled.  \"Not at all.\"", "John pulled a silencer from his chest holster and shot Jasper once in the head.  The force of the impact sent Jasper rolling backwards as John turned on his heels and pulled the door shut behind him.    ", "The cold linoleum felt great on my face, at least that's what I told myself as I laid on the floor in a drunken stupor for the third time this week. It seems like when ever it's the most inconvenient the three quick knocks echo through the house and I'm summoned to the door.

This test is going to be great. ", "The tests are never the same. They're never short, and I can never tell if I get the answers right. They seem neither pleased, nor concerned at any of the answers I give. But they always start the same, with Dr. Lambert entering a combination into his attache case, popping the levers simultaneously and revealing a manila folder. He takes it out in an almost surgical fashion and opens it to show a neatly categorized test. ", "We painstakingly go through the categories: Finance, Foreign Policy, Domestic Policy - they ask me about current events but never questions about politicians. Each question he asked ate at me a little more. The words somehow hitting my body and causing me to want to lash out. I deserved it for being so drunk, I suppose. I was losing my patience.", "Dr. Lambert was finishing his final question in the two hour test when Dr. Thomas clears his throat and in his best attempt at casually asking mutters \"What do you think about Trump?\"", "\"Uhhh\" I paused. \"I don't know, he's kind of an idiot, I guess?\" ", "Dr. Thomas drew the immediate attention of Dr. Lambert, and Dr. Howard let a nervous laugh out and tried to speed along gathering their things.

Distant thunder rolled in the distance.", "Howard leaned back into the car and retrieved a black leather messenger-bag type suitcase and matching legal pad folder.  The case contained a roll of cash, a digital recorder, and a one-pound bag of potent marijuana.  The case was that serious. It was time to see Delphi.", "The thought of approaching Delphi was terrifying for both of them.  Consulting the Oracle always had risks, and even a slightly misinterpreted statement could result in millions of deaths.  Martinez shuddered to think about the last time the interpretation was off; four countries in the Middle East had effectively ceased to exist as a result.", "Delphi, the Oracle's official codename, lived at the end of a long dirt road in the hills that sit between Georgia and Tennessee.  The setting was more than appropriate, considering the subject. The clairvoyant, however, did not match.", "Howard and Martinez knocked on the screen door of a single-wide trailer sitting on cinder blocks,  no answer.  The agents knocked again, still no answer.  In the distance, a bobwhite gave out its distinctive call and a gentle breeze blew through the trees.", "The two sounds startled the agents. Howard dropped the bag while turning. Both drew pistols from their holsters and aimed in the direction of the sound.  Silence covered the forrest.", "Out of the woods stepped an elderly man in a flannel shirt and cowboy hat.

She'd been getting the packages for a whole month now, after she complained online that there were too many dogs. If she had her way, everyone would have cats and the dogs could all go to the moon for all she cared.

Their is a man who controls the world. He dictates every major decision and is responsible for all events, both bad and good, that occur. The world is split between love for the unity he brings, and hate for the tyranny and prejudice that comes from a single ruler. Would it be better to leave the man in power, or kill him to return the world to a democratic society?\"", "That's a tough one. I think about it for a long while. The men respectfully remain silent and drink from their cups as they await my answer.", "\"This is one of the more difficult questions I've been brought,\" I admit to them. \"I think mankind as a whole is a hysterical species. Everyone wants what they think is right, but no one can ever truly agree on what is right. Opinions change and people have a hard time agreeing with anything that isn't in accordance with their own ideals. However, mankind deserves to be as free as possible. One man can't control the world. The dissent he would eventually sow would be too great. Anarchy would rise and the people would eventually overthrow him. It's been seen many times in the past. If their was a plan to ensure a democracy would arise from his death, I would say kill the man.\"", "The two men look at each other. The aristocrat looks a little more weary than when he arrived. I guess he didn't like my answer. It happens from time to time. These people come here and seek my knowledge.

Others, like me, believe that it's more likely they are just interpreting the same characters differently.", "Most people agree that the library is finite. This observation is most often defended by supposition that all books exist in the library, which most people take for granted, as what else is there, and the fact that, given each book has exactly 188,452 characters, the total number of unique books, although enormous to calculate, has a number. This gives hope to seekers and tribes throughout the Library, as that means that every possible book in every possible manifestation, from Shakespeare's unwritten plays, to the correct and accurate events of Christ's death, to the book that describes why the library exists at all, how to escape the library, its purpose, etc., exists somewhere within the Library.", "There's a story a seeker managed to hear from about twenty stories up, where people had sort of moved beyond the need to talk and their tribe only communicated in shallow grunts and by pointing to various letters in the books. However they somehow managed to painstakingly signal the meaning to him about a book that was unlike the other books. It has syntax and grammar and was painstakingly written out in stark contrast to the other books of uniform gibberish. It wasn't even the same size; its gargantuan print offset the entire bookshelf. Some people prefer to believe in the book. Some, like me, who have been here a little longer, know better.

Every night in my dreams I visit a library. Not just any library, but the library of all books. All the knowledge mankind has ever gained is saved here. It expands every minute of every day. Every single day. I visit it at night in my sleep. I know it's in my sleep because I spent a year there, I counted the days, though it feels more like a week, perhaps 2. In all that time I didn't need to drink or eat or sleep, but if I want to I can will food into existence and eat to my hearts content. I found out about this when I read about lucid dreaming. Amazing isn't it. The library is a beautiful but strange place. For starters it looks like that building Escher painted. Stairs and walls of books everywhere. Even on the ceiling. And everything moves, constantly. Walls shift, stairs disappear and appear somewhere else. Time seems to stand still, but then you realise 3 days have gone by, just like that.

It's cruel really.", "I can't remember when my first 'night' here was. Or more specific my first consious night here. I don't know for sure if it started right when I was born. All I know is that it's been like this for as long as I can remember, and that I'm not the only one that has seen the library. I've read of other people suddenly knowing more than anyone ever and telling tales of a library dream.", "The best part about the library is my ability to make things appear out of thin air. Especially the animals, I love animals. Dogs, cats, horses, birds, deep sea creatures and so on. Every animal I've ever read about is here. Even dragons. I can also fly here, I can do anything really. Except make the library go away, that I can't. Why? I have no idea, it probably doesn't want me to. I know all this only happens in my dreams, but how can all this knowledge exist in my mind, without me ever learning it? ", "There's another strange thing about this place. The door. I can't open it and I can't 'will' it open. I wonder what's behind there. Something the library doesn't want me to see.. It's a big metal door. Every once in a while I see a bit of light come from underneath. I once pressed my ear against it for a few days when I heard a strange voice. I couldn't fully understand what it was saying but it sounded like '..episodes last a week.... higher dosis...'  I tried more often but i never heard more.

Watson by his side as a sounding board. \nI only have one mystery and no real people to talk to. \nThe others who never leave scare me. They all vary in age, race and sex. The only thing they share is an unwavering fixation in their tomes and blazing blue eyes. I think I must share this look. I once used my sleeve to polish up the walnut desks in the geography section to see 2 blue supernovas twinkling back. \nI tried to talk to one of the others in the year 1st August x2 but I gave her such a fright by breaking the dusty silence that she hid behind the religious text section seeking sanctuary behind the Torah. I gave up shortly after that. Occasionally newcomers pop in for the year but they are normally so excited that they don't want to talk. They obsessively plough themselves into a topic that excites them and ravenously consume the morsels as if it were their first and last meal.\nI remember being that way in my early years. After I had learned to read with the traditional ABC books and Spot the dog, I read the entire works of Roald Dahl, Brothers Grimm and Enid Blyton. I was a slow reader at the time but the experience was an adventure. There was so much to know. I was Richard of the famous five setting out for adventure without the help of grown ups.\nNow I sit with Aldous Huxley by my side debating the merits of his Brave New World.

I quickly discovered that I could read and ingest information at a frightening speed, and spent two years absorbing quantum loop gravity, zero point energy, some of the subtler implications of knot theory. I was convinced that the djinn use traversable wormholes to appear and disappear, and these wormholes were central to their ability to grant wishes. Why they granted wishes, I didn't (and would never) understand.", "When I began to formulate my own theory, it was one minute per day, every day. At first I tried to hold onto that productive energy and continue beyond 20:17, but I found that it meant the next day's minute was wasted revising my mistakes. So I devised a method in which I would very quickly outline the formulation process for a phase of theory in a single minute, and spend subsequent minutes completing the steps of the outline. This was how I developed an efficient means by which to identify exotic matter. Then the detection of wormholes. Then, the use of exotic matter to close both ends of a wormhole but maintain its stability. A wormhole prison.", "At the end of the tenth year, I had an epiphany: I had no idea what I was talking about. My theoretical framework, and the frameworks upon which it was built, were hopelessly primitive.

I travelled just to observe places for a single moment. A pineapple ripening in the island sun. The subtle flap of laundry on the line. Those boys on a park bench, secretly in love. Once, I ate a plum at 20:17, and what moved through me wasn't genus and species, or a visualization of its ripening process, or a contemplation about the metric that describes the shape of this fruit.

I got a night job, and slept from eleven to seven. I drank an energy drink at eight, and sat at my computer, with a pencil and pen nearby. Every day was different - sometimes I would have mathematical formulas seemingly appear on my paper, and other times, I would scribble sonnets that put the Bard's work to shame.

Not having a home leaves you with a lot of time to travel and a lot of time to think. I was passing a neighborhood that was undergoing renovations. Many of the houses had been abandoned decades ago and I had even slept in quite a few of them. But there had always been ONE house that was beyond my reach. Someone must have seen promise in the structure, because unlike the other houses that had their windows and doors blocked off with easy to remove plywood and Philips screws...this one...this one had every entry way covered with metal plates and security torx bits. There were even security cameras. For a while, until lowlifes and teenagers with nothing better to do broke them off the building just for spite.", "So I had been unable to conquer this single dwelling for years...but this time, all the security measures were removed, and a large dumpster sat in the driveway, filled to the brim with stuff. Curiosity edged me on and I'd scrambled up the side of it to take a look inside, to see the treasures that had evaded my grasp.", "Inside were all the usual detritus you would find in an abandoned house: Old Newspapers and warped paperback books, broken dishes, smashed radios and electronics. A single shoe. Always a single shoe...never a PAIR of shoes in a size that I could fit. I dug around a little more, coughing in all the dust that wafted up from the depths of the dumpster, then I spied a cardboard box in a corner, a glint of bronze colored metal shining almost golden in the yellowed streetlamps overhead. I smiled and crawled inside, grunting as I had to lift a ceramic kitchen sink and a Solid oak door off the box. Man they sure didn't make doors like THAT anymore, it weighed half as much as I did. But eventually I freed the box from it's prison and dragged it back up to the top with me.", "Sitting on the edge of the dumpster, I lifted the object from the box and looked it over. It was one of those old time oil lamps, dented and crusted with corrosion. It had apparently had a hard life, it's handle  had come undone on the bottom and had sprung free, and it's spout was bent at an upward angle that would have made it practically useless to light unless you used a shoelace or something as a wick.", "Whatever, I chuckled and picked up an old crusty towel from the dumpster and rubbed it off to get a better look at it. A lot of the corrosion stayed on but most of the dust fell away and a fair bit of unblemished metal gleamed back at me.  I smiled and set it beside me, then went back to search the rest of the box, but I was interrupted as a large gust of wind came out of nowhere. I grunted and placed the box back down and held onto the oak door as the wind stirred up ALL the dirt in the dumpster, throwing it up into my face and my ears and my eyes. I started coughing, holding the towel over my face to help combat the sandstorm I found myself in...but in a few moments, the blizzard of rust and dirt died away and I was left hacking and gasping over the dumpster.", "As I tried to regain my ability to breath, I heard someone calling...", "\u201cYou okay boy\u201d", "I coughed and followed the sound, looking behind me through squinted eyes to see another homeless man standing on the sidewalk, looking up at me with concern. His hair was long and ratty, looking surprisingly like an old well used mop. His face was creased and pitted from age and injuries, but it was wrinkled in all the right places. Arches over the eyebrows, check marks in the corners of his mouth and cheeks...what were those called again, 'laugh lines'? He wore a long winter coat, but what homeless man didn't? It made sure he stayed warm enough at nights and served as armor for when he had to leg it through thorns and wooded areas to make camp. He obviously thought so too, because it was covered in little scraps of fabric from whatever sources he could find to repair holes and rips. And although he was quite old, he was steady on his feet, his back was straight, and he had a twinkle in his eyes that just welcomed you to stay for a while and talk.

Crazy wind we just got...weather getting out of control lately...all those climate change deniers better get their heads outta their asses, cause it's gonna get worse...the signs are everywhere...Say, anything good in there?\u201d", "I spit into the dumpster to clear some of the grit from my mouth.

Don't really need the stuff.\u201d", "He nodded and smiled back. \u201cWell, alright then...is there anything I can do for yah?\u201d", "I chuckled and sighed, looking back into the dumpster to continue my search. \u201cMaybe wish me good luck in 2017...It could really be more productive than the last 7 years been...and I need all the luck I can get...\u201d", "I felt the old man reach up and pat my calf, grasping it and shaking it in his hand once. \u201cDon't worry boy...it will be...\u201d Then he let go.", "I chuckled and leaned back over the dumpster, extending my hand to shake his. \u201cThank's...Sir?\u201d I looked around.

I could hear my heart racing as result after result appeared, automatically following a golden line that traced from site to site, link to link, one obscure reference to another.", "Suddenly, I snapped back in my seat with a gasp, head rolling back as it took all I had to slow my breathing, my heart about to spring from my chest.

Finally he freed the object, retangular and thin.", "Matthew carefully held the artifact and carried it back to the restoration station. He set it down on the glass table of the Defossilizer.

She was going to say something else but stopped herself, it was no use. She turned and left Matthew alone. Matthew fell out of his chair and reached for the door.", "\"No, wait! The title is called Marvel to describe Stan Lee's awesome powers!\" Matthew screamed as Sam left. Very disturbed, Sam decided to relax in the restoration station.

I don't want to miss anything...\" He turned another page, walking absentmindedly down the hall.", "\"Well,\" Chris said, grabbing Stan by the shoulder and steering him into the classroom, narrowly avoiding the door. \"You of all people aren't going to miss anything. You've been reading those things like they've got the secret to the universe hidden somewhere in them.\"", "\"Maybe they do!\" Stan protested as he sank down into his seat. \"We won't know unless we study them. There's just so many...\" he trailed off as the class fell into a hush and their professor strode in. A rather short man in casual dress, he immediately went up to the board and began writing. The students in the classroom knew better than to talk when Professor Howlett was writing. ", "\"Mar...vel...Comics...\" He spoke each syllable aloud as he wrote. He set the chalk down and turned to the class, gathering up a few papers. He eyed his many pupils over his glasses. \"I know many of you have been waiting for this unit. It's a pretty hot topic in modern cultural academia.\" Chris poked Stan, chuckling. \"Nerd,\" he whispered good-naturedly. The latter grinned. Professor Howlett continued, uninterrupted.", "\"So, I'll start. The intellectual world isn't really sure what to make of them since their recent uncovering by North American archaeologists. There's thousands upon thousands, all produced in this unique style, all bearing the same brand, even across languages and geographic regions. The consensus right now, though of course it's subject to change, is that they're, of course, religious texts of some sort, but probably not in the way you're used to thinking about them.\"", "He paused to write something up on the board, and beside Stan, Chris perked up. The professor had written and underlined the word \"METAPHOR\" big and bold.", "\"We're used to thinking of religion as theistic, that adherents usually have a belief system that was supposed to explain how the world worked. Within Marvel Comics, there doesn't seem to be a unifying consensus on the nature of the universe.", "\"For example,\" he continued, writing the main points up on the board, \"in the Abrahamic tradition, we see a recurring character called God, who is supposedly all-seeing and all-powerful. We see several analogues to someone like this in Marvel Comics, and it's likely the religion borrowed from the Abrahamic tradition, similar to how the Abrahamic traditions borrowed from old Zoroastrian and Greek idols. Characters like Uatu the Watcher or Thanos can be seen as beings of immense power and sight, but no one seems to be 'the one true God.'\" He punctuated his point with a loud period. Stan leaned forward, enraptured. ", "\"Now, we could classify it as a polytheistic tradition, in the same vein as Hinduism or the Greek Pantheon. But there doesn't seem to be a system of classification of deities, nor a consistent explanation for their powers. Can someone give me an example of this kind of discrepancy in lore?\"", "Stan raised his hand. \"Yes, Stan?\"", "\"Um, the mutants and the Inhumans, sir,\" Stan cleared his throat. \"They seem to fulfill similar roles in the Marvellian worldview, but they've got drastically different origins.\"", "The Professor smiled. \"Correct. Both are supposedly races of humanoids gifted with strange powers and abilities from evolution, but while the mutants are supposed to be hated and feared by their human counterparts, the Inhumans seem to be able to establish a powerful dynasty and a homeland for their race.\" He paused to adjust his glasses. \n\"So how can we explain these discrepancies within the lore? As we said, there doesn't seem to be an overarching structure or system of deification, or an explanation of how the world is supposed to work. It'd baffling for modern people like me who make a living off this stuff,\" the class laughed.", "\"The answer, or at least my answer- Professor Kirby may dispute this- is that these stories aren't meant to be taken literally. Instead, I think they function as fables and moral stories, to give the adherents of Marvelism exemplars and teach life lessons that could be applied elsewhere. We see this in multiple significant characters, who I think are supposed to be these kinds of Paragons. The Marvel Comics often call these people 'superheroes'.\" A murmur went through the crowd. Chris scoffed, but Stan was all goosebumps. The professor wrote the term up on the board, and everyone scratched it down quickly. Below, he began writing a list.", "\"One that I think you'll all be familiar with by now is the Spider-Man. He's been one of the mainstays of a lot of the old stories we've come across. Who here can tell me what his whole deal is?\"", "Stan raised his hand again. \"He's a young man who's bitten by a spider,\" he said. \"and he gains the abilities of a spider, like being able to walk on walls and amazing reflexes-\"", "\"Not reflexes,\" someone in the back spoke up. \"Spider-sense. He can sense danger to his person, it's more like precognition.\"", "\"You're both right, to an extent.\" The professor nodded, and wrote the name up on the board. \"But what is the point in having a hero based around a spider? What can we learn from that?\"", "The class was quiet. Stan spoke up again, more confident this time. \"Well, I think the Comics spell that out pretty plainly. In 'Amazing Fantasy' 1962, the narrator says that 'with great power, there must also come great responsibility'. I think the point isn't to have a character who is all-powerful, but who instead has incredible gifts, and has the responsibility to use them, even when he's outclassed by enemies that are far more powerful than he is.\"", "The professor cocked his head sideways. \"Not bad, Stan. Someone's been staying up late.\" The class chuckled, and Stan blushed. ", "\"But the spirit of the answer is still there. These heroes typically revolved around a theme or some other kind of trope meant to convey a lesson.\" He turned back to the board, and wrote four more names down.", "\"The Incredible Hulk,\" he pointed to the first one. \"A scientist, a brilliant man, turned into a massive creature of unimaginable strength when he became angry, and could fly into an uncontrollable rage.\" He tapped his head. \"Control your demons, lest they control you.", "\"Captain America,\" he pointed to the second. \"Is a little trickier. We've got some evidence that points to him being wartime propaganda, a weapon against fascism. But it's punctuated by the fact that prior to his transformation, he was a young, sickly man, from a poor city, who had a good, strong heart. He grew to embody the ideals of his country- that of strength and valor, but also peace, acceptance, and love. It's no coincidence the authors depict him as a solider carrying nothing but an indestructible shield, not a sword or a gun.", "\"The Fantastic Four,\" he gestured to the third. \"A family of explorers. Again, granted superhuman powers through a freak accident in what was then the far reaches of space-there's that transformation motif again. Their strength came from their unity and their bonds, and working together.", "\"The X-Men,\" he pointed to the last. \"A group of people who were marginalized for their abilities, and scorned from society. And what do they do? They try to use their powers to help others and promote peace and understanding. Their sworn enemy, another mutant named Magneto-\" The class burst out laughing, and the professor cracked a smile. \"It's the best translation we have, folks. Magneto was a mutant who wanted the opposite, to use his powers to hurt other humans out of fear they would hunt down mutants and kill them.\"", "The professor set the chalk down, and leaned back against his table. A lone paper fell out of his bag, and floated down to the floor before settling. The silence in the room was deafening as he paused for effect.", "\"All of these stories, to get back to Stan's point, illustrate these values and these morals. With great power does come great responsibility, according to Marvel. While I have no doubt that the inclusion of the metahuman aspects of their heroes are for effect, it's an effective means of storytelling and of proliferating your worldview. And it's a powerful statement in the context of the times. In such a divided world, one filled with corruption and authoritarianism and nationalism and anger, it's message is one of hope. That ordinary people have the potential to make an extraordinary impact on the world that they live in.\" He paused to let that sink in.", "\"Now, about your midterms...\"", "The class groaned. ", "\"Stephen\" I said becoming the young man closer. He looked on in shock. He held a hand to his chest, covering the white star surrounded by navy blue on his ceremonial robes.

It took him awhile but then he finally spoke.", "\"Heretics?\" He asked.

He is a disgrace to Cap\" I said. \"Don't let his Nazi lies steer you away from the faith\". ", "\"Karles is a defender of Justice, Democracy and the American Way\" he said.

And showed it to him. He was in awe of it. He tried to touch it, but kept pulling away. ", "\"When you take on the identity of the Cap, you must follow him by example. He didn't kill civilians, even those of the demon lord Hitler. He believed that all can find his Mother Lady Liberty\" I told him, as he held the shield in his hand. ", "\"Sarge. Why then, do we hate the Order?\" He asked me, cheeks blushed in shame. ", "\"It all started in the epic called \"CavalWur\" I said.", "\"Cap and Iran disagreed about how to interact with the world.

Much of it was collapsed and hard to navigate but in the rubble, I found several large tomes labeled \"MARVEL Anthology\". It was on what appeared to be on some sort of ancient shrine because these books were in cases. These books appear to have been printed in an ancient language. It looks like it was published in an ancient form of English in 2023, a few months before the assassination of Vladimir Putin, the President of the Former Russian Federation, which started World War III. These large tomes seem to be a collection of stories documented by a man named Stanley Lee, depicting a large pantheon of gods. I can only assume he was a prophet who documented their time protecting mankind. I must share my findings with my colleagues.", "Friday, the 2nd of May, 3017", "It has been 12 days since I uncovered the Anthology. It appears these tomes were found all around the world. A colleague of mine in Mordvinia found a copy of written in what appears to be an ancient Slavic language. Solely based on the location, I'd guess Russian.

The religion described in these books has become one of the most popular religions in the world.", "\"Quiet, Qunitus.\" Brutus stood at the helm of the class, his armoured hand gripping the marbled podium. His naked hand was resting on the steam engine's lever. \"We will discuss the histories of old during next period; the Imperator insists that this demonstration takes place within the allocated break time.\"", "Quintus fell back into silence, as had the rest of the class. They had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor, pondering what it could possibly be. Brutus pushed the lever into position, revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms. The class gasped at the hidden fires, some edging away, while others edged closer. Within minutes of the reveal, steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison. From overhead, light began to pour into the room - startling the students.", "\"Do you understand what has just happened?\" Brutus took no time to wait for an answer, assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question. \"The steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers, which in turn drove the gears to turn.\" Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair, without taking a moment\u2019s break from his speech. \"These two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up. As you may have noticed, the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating, to allow for such an event as this.\"", "None of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine, but the display had been completed, which was all Brutus cared for. His position was not to showcase the Imperator's power, but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with. \"If you have any questions, you may ask Professor Alexander, for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than I.\" The class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal, but it died down as the armoured hand of Brutus rose into the air as to silence them.", "\"So, as the impatient Quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories, he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that I will assume you all equally have.\" Motioning for Quintus to speak, Brutus pulled back the lever to silence the roaring fires behind him. \"Well... I have an understanding of our rise to glory, but I'm poorly equipped to discuss the ancients.\"", "Brutus knew that was a lie, but appreciated the desire to know that his class shared with him. \"Very well, we will start with the mightiest ancients we know of: The Romans, the Mongols, the Marvels, and the most recent to fall: The coalition of the Europeans, Americans, Chinese, and Russanadians, known as the Union Nations.\" Brutus walked over to a large granite globe, pointing at the southernmost portion of the Roman Leg. \"This is where the glory of civilization began, with the birth of Rome. We know very little of the immense empire, but we do know within years they conquered the world. The tales of Julius Caesar, who claimed all of Gaul, Igyt, and then ascending unto Divus Augustus to conquer a distant land called Olympus. Not only did he survive assassination, he then transformed a weak civilization into the strongest empire even known.\"", "Walking over to the now cooled steam engine, Brutus paused for a moment to appreciate man\u2019s potential. \"This steam engine isn't even a seed compared to the vast tree of technological prowess the Romans achieved. It's been far too many thousands of years to uncover any of their technology, but the Union Nations viewed the Romans with such unequivocal admiration, that it must've been breathtaking. The Union Nations were able to place man not only on our once whole moon, but on Mars! They lived among the stars, while creating life from machines and ripping apart the very fabric of our realm to use in war. Imagine what awe inspiring power the Romans must've wielded.\"", "As Brutus spoke, he left pauses after each sentence to let them soak in the accomplishments of man. He made his way towards the sundial outside, noting how much longer they had before conscription for daily labour began. \"Since we don't have much time left, I'll briefly outline the rest of the histories. After the eventual fall of Rome, there was a period of ruination for man; however, out of this ruin arose the largest empire until the Union Nations. The Mongols, led by Gengis Tzan, had great machines of war called the Horde. While it remains unclear how they worked or what they did exactly, it is clear that they were unchallenged as the supreme weapon of Earth. After Napleson the Great lost control of the empire, the Vacacin led a great crusade which caused an eventual dark ages. The only information we have on this period is of the great heroes.\"", "A few of the students groaned, not wanting to hear of what they thought were mythological exaggerations used as propaganda for the poor peasant rulers of the era. Brutus decided he wanted to hear what his class knew of the Marvels. \"Pupils! What do you know of the Marvels? Who were their heroes?\" Temjin stood, waiting to be chosen. \"Hail Temjin, whom do you know of?\" Clearly nervous, Temjin fiddled with his bracer, unhooking it from his black satin toga. \"There were the Spider Men, most likely a group of glorified highway men...\"", "A slight laugh escaped Brutus's mouth, as he turned to face the veranda. He imagined the armoured assassin squad vaulting over the ruins and onto the freshly built gate, it was humorous to imagine highway men doing the same. Piggish obese men, poorly equipped to do anything more than frighten starving country folk. \"I highly doubt the retractable whips and hypersensitive annex of their gloves was funded by highway robbery. I understand you're hesitant to accept such incredible tales, but you can take a look outside after class and wonder at the Hollow Moon. You mustn't doubt our capability as man.\"", "Before he could summarize the Union Nations or how their collapse led to the rise of his great people, the horn rung out over all the ambient sounds of college. As the horns song ended, so started the chaos of hundreds of classes all scrambling to be conscripted for the higher quality jobs. Brutus was glad he had secured such an esteemed position so early in the Imperators reign, it allowed him to build rapport with him and secure himself in the innercircle of the Imperators Hall. A sharp ", " rung out through the room, startling Brutus. A courier gave him a sheepish smile, while looking down to avoid angering a superior. \"Hail Philo, a message for Brutus from the Imperator, to be read with haste.\" He set a folded letter branded with the esteemed seal on the prayer table near the archway, backing away to continue his rounds. ", "\"What do you want this early in the day?\" Brutus retrieved the parchment and read it. ", "Hail Philo, we have secured multiple artefacts that are of importance to your field of interest. Before examination and repurposing, your confirmation of identification and documentation is required. Come with haste, you are relieved of any duties normally your responsibility. ", "It was an intriguing letter, clearly something of great importance if it has taken the attention of the Imperator away from beginning laying out plans for industrialization. Brutus wasn't entirely sure what sort of discovery could be so important, but he had an idea of a few things they could be. Having collected his things, he slipped them all into his bag and shouldered it. Once everything was clipped into place, he adorned his cloak, the bright crimson contrasting his dark robes. Upon exiting the college, he flagged down his driver.", "\"Hail Taxio, to the Imperator's great palace. Slow for none.\" Before Brutus had fully settled in the back of the chariot, his driver had already pulled out and onto the ancient road of Hiw Ay, the horses showing little regard for the many poorly filled potholes in the cement. It had taken decades to undo the millennia of ruin and yet it was barely traversal for the finest horses. But if there was a significant discovery, it was the only route worth considering. Brutus hoped the archaeological team had uncovered perhaps the remains of a metal limb or more of the rarely preserved scrolls in one of their plastic sleeves. Deep in thought, he admired the armour the adorned his left hand; a near perfect replication of armour worn by the Iron Avenger, Stark. Some of the most valuable metals known to man were imbued in his mark of excellence, bestowed upon him by the Imperator in the first year of his reign.

There were marble walls and intricate statues of Greek gods and ferocious animals. Is was as though every museum in the entire world had been looted and their treasures had been brought here by an army of thieves.", "There were waterfalls throughout the city with lamposts all along and all throughout. The lamposts had the familiar glow that told me they ran on electricity, or they seemed to at least..", "Then a man flew from one side of the city to the other.", "\"What the-\"", "\"Keep up,\" a distant voice said from a stairway below me.", "I scrambled down the stairs like an eager child.", "\"Are you hungry?\"", "\"I just ate actually.\"", "\" Oh you may want to indulge in a bit of gluttony, with the grand tournament going on today.

IN COLLEGE! \nI can't fight in a tournament!\"", "\"Oh I'm not worth it?\"", "\"What? No! What are you crazy?\"", "All at once all the magical bullshit didn't even matter.

I turned and saw Peter with a wink in his eye.", "I shoved him off, and walked away, irritated. Probably trying to sell something. ", "I made it back to the hotel room safe and sound, collapsing onto the bed with a groan. Too many flights. Not enough rest. Too much airline food and shitty wi-fi.", "As I lay on my back, hands over my closed eyes, I shivered involuntarily. A low hum went through the room, and I couldn't breathe for a second. I sat up heavily, forced my eyes open, dragged in a breath. ", "Probably just jetlag.", "I took in the city view from my balcony. Beautiful, and the ocean beyond, framing the horizon, made it even better. I looked down and took a queasy step back from the edge, shifting uneasily on the glass deck. Seventeen floors was a lot for a nice view.", "Room service came and went, me typing out an email in response to my sister. Dad was doing fine - same as always, at least - and wanted an update. I tapped out an overview of the Beijing stopover - that one had been just for him, my company doesn't have offices out there. He'd wanted me to do the tourist thing, pictures, souvenirs - I had them all packed in my duffel, waiting to show him when I got home.", "Unconsciousness came quickly, but didn't stay long. Uneven stopovers had my sleep patterns shot to hell. I kept waking up with a start, clutching frantically at my phone to check for alarms.", "The third time, I stretched and groaned, giving in to the call of the porcelain siren. As I relieved myself, I felt again that hum from earlier. Strange.", "I walked back through the kitchenette, looking for a glass for water, when a light through the window caught my eye. Odd. There weren't any other tall buildings between the hotel and the coast. It must be a cruise liner out at sea.", "Still, it was bright, to have caught my eye from so far away. After sating my thirst, I walked to the window. ", "I couldn't tell what I was looking at. The light - greenish-blue, wavy, pulsing - definitely wasn't a cruise liner. It was halfway to the horizon, but somehow under the water - not on top of it. Puzzled, I undid the latch on the door and stepped out onto the glass balcony. Instantly, the hum rose in pitch, a little chorus in the back of my brain.", "The longer I looked, the brighter the light grew. But still - transparent, wavering. I heard a noise below me, and looked down - another restless sleeper, in the suite one floor down. I almost looked away, but something caught my eye.", "I could see his outline, glowing faintly red... ", " the walls of the rooms.", "I shook my head, blaming the darkness, my tired eyes, but even closed the outline persisted. After another moment, it lay still. I turned to do the same, but a hazy pink chorus assaulted my line of sight - somehow, I could see the edges of every person, in every room around me.", "I looked out at the light again. Somehow, I knew. Whatever it was, it was calling me. Had connected to me somehow. I'd looked too long, it was giving me more to see than I'd expected. More than I'd wanted.", "The elevator ride down the first floor was well-lit, distracting in its intensity. The bathrobe fluttered around my ankles as I stepped out into the lobby, past the front doors and out into the street. The first taxi ignored me. The second. But the third takes me. I can barely stand to look at the driver - his cherry glow overwhelms me as I slide into his cab, cigarette butt a needle-pinprick in my eyes.", "We drive straight out to the beach, something pulling me in a dead line toward the sea.", "The city lights hurt. I could see them more clearly now, see the electricity running through the wires, the heat rising from the people sleeping, living, working. The squeal of tires on pavement couldn't drown out the hum growing louder and louder inside my head.", "The surf swirled around my ankles as I stepped to the waters edge. Free of my sandals, the sand sifted through my toes, the waves sinking my feet deeper and deeper into the sand. I looked up, eyes locked on the mysterious light.", "It was underwater, I could see that now. Deep. But how deep? It looked almost close enough to swim to...", "The water took another second to tug forcefully at my ankles, and I tottered. But just as quickly, it receded, and became still. ", "I looked down the deserted beach. The waves had stopped, the ocean stretching into a calm, mirrored surface. Behind me, the city clamored on; even in the pre-dawn darkness it was bright as the sun. Lights, people, cars and all manner of activity - it was clamoring, chaotic, a stark contrast to the peacefulness of the sea.", "I turned away, eyes stinging. I could hardly look at the great city behind me, so painful were my senses.", "The water parted before me. I'd almost expected it. A tunnel reaching into the depths of the ocean, shimmering with moonlight. The light was waiting for me. So I followed.", "I walk still, ever deeper, and I do not know what I will find. Respite from the glow above, at least. My eyes rest easy now. Already I've acclimated to the dark. The coolness is refreshing.", "The glow still waits for me below.", "I stepped off the plane with a triumphant spring, the sun beating down on me. I had done it, all seven continents visited in seven months- with enough time to take in the culture and individual beauty of each one.  I swaggered down the steps with a wry smile, I\u2019d always wanted to travel but had never had the spontaneity to implore myself to undertake the challenge, I had conquered my habit of procrastination and it felt amazing. ", "Pride emanating from me, I made my way to the arrivals desk, when I saw a man, he couldn\u2019t have been younger than 60, steadily approaching with a facial expression that I couldn\u2019t quite make out. Upon closer examination of the lines on his face and wideness of his eyes, I deduced that he wasn\u2019t quite all there, and made sure to avoid his gaze and quicken my pace. I continued to walk with my head down when I was stopped, it felt like I\u2019d hit a brick wall. I looked up in confusion and saw the man standing there, looking down on me with that same fear inducing expression that had repelled me from him just prior. I stood up indignantly and confronted him.", "\u201cHey buddy what the hell is your probl-\u201c, the words froze on my tongue and retreated, and I found that I couldn\u2019t move, I could only stare at him; wide eyed and terrified. He leaned in close to me and whispered, \u2018Atlantis unlocked\u2019. His voice was ghostly and distorted, yet he somehow sounded well intentioned. I regained control of my body and stared at him breathlessly, looking around to see if anyone else had witnessed whatever the fuck had just happened- their obliviousness frightened me further. The man had adopted a softer facial expression now, he was smiling at me as if I was a long lost friend. I looked at his outstretched arm, \u2018Take it\u2019, he said- as if he\u2019d just offered me some gum. I stared at his arm and back at him, still catching my breath I considered his proposal for a split second, \u2018Atlantis unlocked\u2019, what does it mean? My open mindedness did not last long, and I stumbled past him and broke into a run, heading to the arrivals gate- I didn\u2019t look back.  ", "\u201cPassport please\u201d, I snapped out of my trance as I met the gaze of a quizzical looking woman, the tone of her voice suggesting that she was somewhat tired of weird tourists wasting her time. \u201cUh, sorry\u201d I blurted out, embarrassed and on edge, still reeling from the encounter. I handed over my passport and gathered the courage to look back and try to locate the man, he\u2019d vanished, which comforted me somewhat. I turned around to pick up my passport and saw that the woman had offered her hand to me, an odd custom to be sure but a welcome one, I took it and smiled at him, making eye contact just before everything went black. ", "I had unlocked Atlantis, and it looked like I wasn\u2019t going to be able to avoid the consequences. ", "Edit: changed formatting to make it sort of readable :) ", "The world is at last within my memories, like so many others before me. Jacob, who had been with me our since meeting at a flea market in Bangladesh, had been a great companion and friend during our travels. Getting off the plane, I knew this was it. He would finally be home and I would have completed today's rite of passage. Exiting the plane I sighed a great breath, images of the past year strobing through my head at once. The achievement seemed too huge to have completed in just one year, but now looking back, it felt like yesterday that I was leaving Chicago with a backpack on my shoulder and my head held high. Jacob had been living in Bangladesh doing volunteer work for impoverished citizens and so happened to finish his obligations just as I came into town. Our towering bodies and light skin in the crowd made it easy to see each other over the busy merchants prodding the hungry patrons along the path. I drifted toward him through the sea of people, hoping to make a new friend, as I often did during my travels to different countries. I discovered that he was planning to travel before returning home and from there, we went on our way. At the end of the exit ramp I turned back to see Jacob smiling ear to ear. He had talked about this place. The warm weather, the beaches, and most of all his family who he hadn't seen in nearly three years. I matched his pace and we headed for baggage claim. Jacob had bought a leather trunk from our last stop in Rabat, it was filled with small area rugs and fabrics from Morocco, which proved to be quite heavy as we lifted it from the carousel and made our way to sliding glass exit doors. ", "As soon as they opened, a deafening roar opened in front of us. Jacob was immediately mobbed by several young kids and a crying woman who I knew instantly to be his mother and siblings. The trunk plopped on the ground and Jacob embraced them all with his hands, looking each of them in the eyes. I knew this was where it was to end for us. He was home and I was looking forward to spend the next week off my feet at a resort on the ocean 30 minutes from the airport. He stood up, turned to his mother and hugged her. The kids clambored onto the trunk and poked st their eldest brother still, speaking endearing Portuguese and throwing a curious glance to me from time to time during the excitement. When his mother let go he introduced me in his tongue, they smiled and belched practiced hellos to me in which I returned. He turned back to them and ushered them to the curb where we loaded the trunk into the back of a light green van. Jacob threw his pack into the back, and closed the doors. As his family got into the van, I noticed a man just off to the side of the sliding glass doors. He was staring, curiously in our direction. He was tall, white haired with a handlebar moustache and wore a light blue blazer over a polished ensemble of whites and cr\u00e8me colored choices. His shoes, the same light cloud blue as his jacket. He flashed a smile just as   Jacob opened the passenger side door and turned to me to say \"Paul, are you sure you don't want a ride to the resort? It's not any trouble at all.\"\n\"Thanks Jacob, but I'm really okay\" I replied. He had been nagging me since I told him of my spa getaway as a reward for my accomplishments. \"Okay man, but if you get bored down at that 5 star joint, give me a call. After the jet lag of course.\" With that we hugged and as his van pulled away I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. I felt many things. I'd seen a lot. But all I could think of was my journey. The thought of going back home to Chicago began to give me anxiety. I puffed the cigarette and turned around to walk towards to ash bin. Nobody was near, or so I thought. As I dashed the bud out onto the tray, I felt two hands wrap around my shoulders from behind. It was quick and strong, I looked down to see light blue sleeves. Panic rose in me and suddenly in my left ear, the words ringing loudly and clearly. \"Atlantis unlocked\" ", "I don't think I was out for long. A woman panting nervously by my body on the ground next me was elated to see me come to my senses. I cautiously got up and asked over and over what happened. She ushered me to a bench nearby and sat me down. My vision seemed blurry, out of focus and desaturated. I couldn't think of a medical reason for this happening to me. The last thing I remembered was seeing Jacob go and then feeling... something. I opened my eyes wider to try and expel the effects me, but nothing cleared my vision. I begged the woman to leave me be, even though I was still groggy. When I lit a cigarette she back away. I sat staring at the ground looking at the trees and the cars passing by here in front of the terminal. None of them looked at I remembered. Most of the cars seemed gray and washed out. The tail lights glowing a very feint white, burning not nearly as bright as they should during this evening dusk. I was genuinely confused. I pieced together that I feinted, but felt no effects other than my vision. I thought it could be brain damage, but I did feel fine. I felt my head and my neck and that's when I remembered those hands. The hands that came from behind with the airy sky blue sleeves and the... the... stone cuff links. I looked around for the man who I'd seen, but he wasn't in sight. I got up and walked down the busy terminal pick up and made my way around the corner, my vision still blurry and grey. And then, in the distance a bright neon blue car. It was the only thing colored in my sights. Looking back now, I can say that it felt like the car was mine. It was meant for me. I didn't know how to explain it, but on approaching the car and seeing that it was a new Tesla model, I couldn't resist not entering the car when the doors unlocked right before my wide and astonished eyes. I got in, shut the door and didn't even feel the engine glide to life. The wheel moved and and I sat in amazement. \"Welcome Paul and congratulations. Atlantis is unlocked. Confirm travel authorization?\" The voice was metallic and female. \"Yes\" I said with no hesitation. The car whipped out of the lot and into the crowded street on autopilot. I couldn't believe my eyes. ", "The city of Buenos Aires was on the Atlantic, and the view was astounding. It would have been better had the trees and buildings had color to them. In fact, I found myself sitting in silence searching for color like I had seen of the car. Looking through the windshield, I saw that the car no longer glimmered in a neon blue. It was Grey like everything else. I was pleased to feel my vision sharpening. Things were becoming clearer and I could focus on things like distance and detail. Then I focused on something that caught my attention. It was in the distance. Very far in the distance. Past the coastline and beaches and straight onto the horizon. It was glowing, gold and aqua marine beams of light dancing over the ocean line. The car peaked over a large hill coming to the ocean city limits, and I could see this sight just slightly better. More colors of jasmin and mulberry fluttered through the distance of the coast of Buenos Aires. As we wanted the bay, I looked around at the grey world around me. Grey faces and shops and life inhabited every inch around us. I remember feeling proud of being in a Tesla. But I also remember nothing remarkable about the drive to the dock. In fact, nobody looked my direction or at the car at all. It was something that I'd thought they'd notice, but never once did I see anyone glare at me in the sought after Telsa. I learned why when I got out and shut the door to see that the Tesla was maybe not a Tesla at all, but a beat up coupe with a rear tire low on air. Before I could open the door to double check that I was, in fact, riding in an expensive climate controlled, fully automated luxury car for the past half hour, it locked its doors and rolled away. ", "I turned around to see the colors before me in the distance. A dock below harbored boats and small wooden rafts. The collage of illumination called to me unlike any other sight I had ever seen, even in all of my travels around the world. The car mentioned Atlantis, at least I thought it had. Didn't the man? Could this be the aura of Atlantis? I was perplexed as all when I looked toward the dock where I immediately fixed my gaze upon a familiar face with a hint of color to it. His suit was glowing a light sky blue and his grey hair was blowing slightly in the sea breeze. He looked to me and smiled. My body seized up at that point. He motioned to me with his hand and waved, then pointing to his left where a large sailboat tied to the post was bobbing under a dim dock lamp. I noticed it too had a light blue aura to it. My body, still tense with the unnatural occurrence of events, loosened as I looked to the lights in the distance. They glittered, intertwined in the horizon over the dark grey sea, captivating me into a trance. I looked back toward the sailboat and the grey haired man, his hands waving me down once more. They all seemed connected. The man to the boat and the boat to the cascade of lights in the distance, as if the boat itself wore the colors of the distant display in its aura. Approaching gave me butterflies in my stomach, I didn't know why my legs kept shuffling toward the man. He smiled as I closed in and asked one question, \"You ready?\" I couldn't possibly have been ready for what was to come. ", "It was a whisper. It may have been a joke. I didn't mind and keep going. Buenos aires, the birth place of Tango. I was planning to go to \"El Caminito\" on the afternoon, but first I needed to get my luggage on the Hotel.", "It was a rough week, On Monday I went from Nigeria to India, then on Tuesday to Melbourne, on Tuesday to France, and then immediatly to the Antarctica. A rough week for a climate scientist. It was a short stay on Antarctica, and I was ready to rest a little bit on Buenos Aires, before going back to my place in Arizona.", "Also, let me tell you, the jet lag can be horrible when you travel so much, specially if you consider the time changes, the noise of the plane and the eternal summer in Antarctica. Of course it was an allucination.", "I inadvertelly slept in my hotel room and woke up. A quick shower and ready to go to \"El Caminito\", while taking a shower, an earthquake!. I couldn't get out, but no alarms. I tried to open the window, but it was completely dark.", "I felt completly dissorientated, as if I was in an airplane again. I took some pills and said, better to sleep some more.", "On the morning a bright light came from the window that was still open. But the landscape was different than the previous day. It feel strange. There were not people walking on the street, and the previously loud city felt abandoned. I went to the reception and asked for a map of the city. Attlantis was the tittle.", "I was perplexed when I went outside the hotel. A giant dome, so big that you couldn't see the end and taller than the highest skyscrappers I can imagine. Outside the dome, on the top I could see the sea, but it was partially underground.

At least they had provided him with that much - the can, and his old work uniform. He wished they had done more. ", "\"Afraid so, Steven.\" St. Peter said, laying a warm hand on his shoulder. \"It's the same for everyone, and everything. Heaven may be large, but it is not infinitely so. We're simply running out of space. For what it's worth, I'm sorry.\" ", "\"But...everything we've ever killed? Is that really necessary?\" Steven said. \"It seems a little...cruel, if you ask me. Even if they win, hundreds will have to die again.\" ", "To Steven's surprise, the angel chuckled. \"Only the ones with souls, Steven.\" He said. \"Just be glad that you aren't a hunter. Or that God, in his infinite wisdom, neglected to give bacteria access to paradise. Truly, ", " would be a match made in hell.\" ", "Steven swallowed, then nodded. \"Ok...I think I'm ready.\" He said. ", "\"Very well then, Steven.\" Said Peter. \"Close your eyes, and we can begin.\"", "Steven closed his eyes. Almost immediately, however, the sound of cheering made him open them again. He was in an arena much like the Colosseum, complete with red-sand floor and stands filled to the brim with shining spirits. They seemed to blend together into a single mass of rainbow hue, so much so that he couldn't tell where one ended and the next began.  Sensing something was expected of him, he raised his hand, and the cheer redoubled in volume. Strangely, however, he seemed to be alone - not a trace of his competition seemed to be present. ", "\"Combatants! Are you ready?\" Cried a voice that echoed from all directions. ", "\"I...I am...\" Steven replied. Still, he saw no sign of his opponent. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw it: A singular cockroach, barely an inch long, standing not fifty feet in front of him. ", "\"Begin!\" Cried the voice. ", "The cockroach rushed him. It tore across the sand, baring down on him with what must have been incredible speed for the species - but it still took several seconds before it could close the gap between. By then, Steven was ready. With instincts born from years of honing his craft, he raised his boot, dropped it...and it was done. The beast was no more. ", "The crowd seemed to wince, growing silent for a moment before erupting into cheers even louder than before. ", "\"Excellent, Steven!\" Cried the announcer. \"You have beaten your first opponent! Would you like to take a rest, to reconvene on the morrow, or shall you have another?\" ", "\"Er, uh...I think I can take another?\" Steven said uncertainly. ", "\"He says another!\" Confirmed the announcer. \"Send in the next opponent!\" ", "The crowd went wild. ", "I could hear them before I could see them-- a low, ominous buzzing that grew steadily louder until it sounded like I was in the center of a tornado of electricity. I imagined what they looked like--swarms upon swarms of cockroaches, bedbugs, ants and mites; millions of pointed insect legs skittering over the floor, millions of pinchers vengefully extended.", "I watched the pearly gates fade away as the cumulous cloud that had borne me up into limbo drifted into the dark arena.", "\"So much for all that morality bullshit,\" I thought distantly, and immediately resented all those untold hours spent listening to Father Simon drone on about moral responsibility and helping old ladies across the street.", "\"I might as well have been snorting cocaine and having sex with strangers. Seen what all the fuss was about, if I'm just gonna end up down there anyway.\"", "The cloud landed with a soft \"pffft\" on a hard cobblestone surface, and then dissolved into the air. I kept my eyes on the stones for a few more seconds, savoring my last few moments as a free soul.", "When I looked up, it was even worse than I imagined. The area looked to be about the size of a football stadium, and every wall was throbbing with glittery black bodies. The portal to hell was several feet to my left, blistering with heat and clearly broadcasting the tortured screams of the souls trapped within. At the other end of the arena, just barely visible, was the pure white pulsing of the portal to heaven. Between me and it was a solid two hundred yards of furious insect. ", "I closed my eyes so that I wouldn't have to see whatever happened next in addition to feeling it. ", "The buzzing grew louder, as well as the clicking of their pinchers. And then... another sound. A pure, ringing thud. It was much, much too heavy to belong to any creature I had ever exterminated. I opened my eyes.", "Before me, in front of the swarm of insects, stood a horse. It wasn't beautiful- no palomino of the afterlife. Just a simple gray draft horse.  I stared at it a moment, perplexed. Then, the memory flooded back.", "I was about 14, coming back from a long camping trip alone in the woods. I'd heard a strange sound coming from a ditch on the side of the road. Curious,  and too young to think to be scared, I looked in. It was the horse, thrashing back and forth in agony. I could see from where I was standing that all four of its legs were broken, and I knew what that meant for a horse. An injury like that couldn't be healed.", "There had only been one humane thing to do in that moment, and I'd done it. With an old hunting rifle, I'd put the horse out of its misery and spared it any further pain. I'd killed it. And now, here it stood.", "The horse watched me. It seemed expectant. I gazed at it one more moment in awe and surprise and then took a deep breath. I had maybe one chance. It was a long shot, but clearly the only option I had. I climbed on the horse.", "It had been a long time since I'd moved so fast. In my last dozen years or so of life, I'd avoided driving and stuck around the house. The horse was galloping powerfully. I heard the bodies of insects crunching as she ran. Faster, faster.", "Then, before I could even bring myself to truly believe it, we were through the portal to heaven. I heard music and laughing and my eyes were dazzled with light. And then, we floated upward, on to our next adventure. ", "It didn't seem so bad at first, when Saint Peter first laid out the rules for entry into heaven. It seemed like a fair trial, with life being sacred and all. Killing another creature is ending its chance at continuing to enjoy its life, it seemed fair that it should get a chance to prevent me from enjoying my afterlife. I quickly started to think about what I was going to face.", "I had never killed anyone, so at least I wouldn't be fighting any humans. I felt better when I thought of that. I wasn't even a hunter, so I had never killed anything like a Bear, or any large mammal really. I hit a deer on the road near home a few year back, so I had that to deal with.", "It was at that moment I started to think about the smaller animals. Those were a different story.", "I had been working 6 days a week, 50 weeks a year, for 35 years at the job I had started at because I answered a classified ad in the local paper as a fresh-faced 18 year old who needed any job that would take him. Every day, rain or shine, I killed every unauthorized creature in any house that called our catchy 800 number. I was an exterminator, and I was damn good.", "I started to freak out when I thought about the ants. So many ants. Each colony is what, a million ants or more? I killed those by the thousands, every week.", "The hornets? The wasps? Oh god.", "Ok, maybe I can run away. Maybe I will just live here in limbo forever. There is no way I can kill all those wasps with my bare hands. I will just run.", "That was my plan, until I suddenly appeared on the battlefield. I wasn't ready, I needed time to plan. Where would I run, what would I use for cover, was there water I could run to? I hadn't killed many fish.", "There were no objects to hide behind. I was just out there, in a white room. The walls were maybe two feet in front of me. I could touch them if I reached out.", "I looked left, and saw a wall maybe 30 feet to the left. The wall on the right was the same. It extended back out of my vision. There was a ceiling around 40 feet in the air, but I had no way of reaching it. From my current view, I appeared to be in a large, but not gigantic, room.", "I quickly turned around, but was not prepared for what lay in front of me. A solid wall of living, moving, substance stood at least 10 feet tall not 10 feet in front of me. It seemed to be pressed up against an invisible wall, a solid barrior keeping the mass from collapsing towards me. If I looked closly, I could see indivdual ants and insects move about.", "Above the mass swarmed a nearly solid swarm of wasps and hornets. They seemed angry, as the clear barrier did not seem to block sound. I could hear them buzzing as a near solid wall of sound. It was deafening.", "I heard a countdown start at 5. I barely had time to think about what was about to happen. 4. I heard Saint Peter say good luck. 3. Is there really only 3 seconds left? 2. Ok it is happening. 1. I need to protect my eyes.", "As the countdown hit 0 and the barrier dropped, I saw the mass collapse towards me. As I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears, I thought about what this was supposed to be for.", "This wasn't heaven.", "This was hell.", "The pits beneath the arena were dimly lit by a handful of torches.  What little light that slipped through the cracks of the boards overhead helped illuminate the area.  It was very similar in nature to the Roman Arenas of antiquity, or so those that had prior knowledge of Ancient Rome thought.  The strange thing about the pits was the random order in which people appeared.  People from periods throughout history were known to appear in the pits as though  time did not move in a single line here.  A man in a black uniform was adjusting his gloves as another approached him.  \"You're looking nervous my friend, why so?  Once you finish your arena fights you'll be blessed with eternal life in heaven!\" ", "The uniformed man looked at the happy stranger, \"You're rather optimistic.\"  ", "\"Ha, well of course, I lived pious life and I can happily say that I only ever killed that which I had to.\"", "\"As you did, though I am certain my number of kills far exceed yours.\"  The man replied back, adjusting several medals and ornate features on his uniform.  ", "\"It can't be so bad,\" the stranger said in turn. ", "\"I was an exterminator in my past life.\"", "\"Oh, well that does change things.  But I am sure you will prevail.\"", "\"No, I knew I would find myself in hell the first time I killed them,\" The Uniformed man said in a near monotone voice as he finished adjusting the silver skulls on his collar and red armband.   ", "As he stepped out through the glowing doorway before him he found himself transported to a very familiar scene.  Wooden barracks, barbwire fences, gallows, all so real he almost thought for a moment that it was a dream and he hadn't actually died yet. Until he heard a crowd of voices call out from behind him, \"Schutzstaffel\".", "The arena was fairly ramshackle, which didn't seem to fit with the whole \"angelic judgement\" vibe. Scia looked around as she traversed the corridors underneath the battleground, where voices could be heard screaming in an uproar. ", "\"You'd think they'd've at least given the place a facelift.\" She murmured.", "\"Scia Orioso, please make your way to the Arena Gates.\"", "Judgement day.", "An angel greeted Scia at the gate.", "\"Hello, my child.\" the angel grinned. \"What will your weapon of choice be? Will you select the flamethrower? The grenades? The water hose? Perhaps the net?\"", "Scia had a brainwave. \"You wouldn't happen to have a gun for this, would you?\"", "\"I... Why? That's almost the worst weapon for this!\" ", "\"C'mon dude, throw us a bone.\"", "\"...Good luck, child of God.\"", "Scia shot herself in the head.", "\"...Ow...My head...\"", "\"That was reckless.\"", "Scia looked up. Standing over her was an archangel. Gabriel? Michael? She could not remember his name.", "\"I have good news and bad news. Which will you hear first?\"", "\"The good news.\"", "\"You committed suicide. While I had the power to bring you back, it was not a simple fix. I had to erase your sins and purify you first. Which means...\"", "\"I don't need to fight the bugs! Haha! I knew the plan would work!\"", "The angel smiled wryly, before his expression hardened.", "\"Ingenious. It's a shame about the bad news though. Suicide is a cardinal sin; unremovable. And the punishment for that sin is being sent to hell.\"", "Scia's euphoria faded.", "\"...So...\"", "\"I pray Lucifer will have mercy on your soul. Although, with his sick, twisted mind, he probably plans on making you fight those creatures anyway.\"", "Scia sat with an aghast look.", "\"You ruined your chance. Your choice is probably going to bug you for the rest of your life.\"", "St Peter finished the briefing and Cletus was sure he saw a flicker of a smirk on his face. Cletus let out a long sigh then he spoke.", "\"So I have to fight every bug I've ever killed?\"", "\"Yes.\" Peter replied. Doing a slightly better job of keeping a straight face. Cletus studied his face for a moment but his expression remained blank. ", "\"You realise that my whole career was as a bug exterminator?\" He said.", "\"Oh?\" Replied Peter feigning surprise, \"it er..\" he flicked through some papers on his desk but didn't seem to actually be reading anything. \"It would seem to be the case, yes.\" He said with an awkward smile. ", "\"Well I'm fucked then aren't I?\" Cletus cried. \"I mean I was fucked from the start, the game was stacked, 40 years ago when I took the job to feed me family.\" ", "\"Well... Ahem, God allows us to make our own choices and...\" ", "\"Our own choices?\" Peter interrupted. \"God is all powerful right?\" \"Well...\" \"And he speaks to us if we listen yes?\" He carried on.", "\"Yes of course! God is all hearing and...\" ", "\"Well I went to church every Sunday\" He interrupted again. \"Every Sunday I went to church and every day I prayed! Do you think maybe he might have mentioned that my career choice wasn't setting me up well for the after life, do you thi...\" There was to be no reply. Peter was gone and the room melted away and he was sitting on the dirt on an empty plain. He could hear the sound of buzzing in the distance and he stood up. Stuck both his middle fingers up at the sky.", "\"Fuck you goooooooooooo....!!!!\" He screamed as the swarm surrounded him and drowned him out.", "\"So let me get this straight.\" Dirk said. \"For every woman I've boned? A quarter pint of semen will be added to a barrel, the barrel will be poured down my throat until it is empty and if I am still alive by the time it is empty I will go to heaven?\" He said incredulously. ", "\"Yes that er... Would appear to be the case.\" Replied Peter matter of factly.", "\"You realise I'm a porn star right I....", "Peter closed the door, just faintly through the door you could hear someone guuuurgling and spluttering \"Fuuccck youuu gooooooahurgespergrreaarrg...!\" ", "He sighed. At the end of the corridor sat God at a desk playing computer games. ", "\"You don't like humans much do you?\" ", "God pulled off his headset. ", "\"What?\" ", "\"Oh n-nothing...\" He stammered. ", "God eyed him suspiciously and then plunged  his hand into a bag of Cheetos. ", "\"Alright, there's a politician in room 4 due to face his obstacle.\" Hopefully he didn't lie too much in his career or he may find it a little difficult!\" God laughed, his laughter grew louder and louder. He could still hear the bellowing as he closed the door behind him.", "God doesn't like humans very much. In truth it was always obvious we just didn't want to see it.", "Edit: Sorry I really am no writer, I just wanted have a go! Advice always welcome, it's the simple things like describing the flow of a conversation without just saying he said, she said that pain me the most. ", "\"So, basically, you have to re-kill everything you've killed, all at once. That's gonna suck for you, Mr. Exterminator.\"", "I go out into the arena. There's a countdown.\n10, 9, 8, 7, 6- \n\"GOOD LUCK, YOU FILTHY MURDERER!\"\n3, 2, 1, GO!!!", "A door opened up on the other side of the arena. The crowd waited anxiously... then booed, disappointed. Only a few spiders crawled out of the door.\n\"I thought you said you were an exterminator! What the hell?\" they shout, outraged.\n\"Yeah, but I was a really shitty one.\"", "I open my eyes. The sky is stone.", "I sit myself up. But no broken bones.", "The screech of tyres, I'll never go home.", "I get the feeling I am not alone.", "I know these sounds, a too familiar drone.", "And by their mercy alone can I atone.", "A life of death, my death does become.", "Hell to remember the sound of just one.", "3,000 years have I been fighting. ", "Every morning, the raccoons scratch at my eyes. Every evening, the skunks spray me while the opossums chew at my feet. I have never had any tools. I have only my hands. I don\u2019t remember the place I came from before this. All I remember is the daily fight between me and these animals. No matter how many times I kill them, they come back the next day. No matter how many times I\u2019ve ripped them limb from limb, they are here for their appointment the next day just as eager to tear me apart. They want my body to be destroyed beyond recognition, and most days they succeed.", "When I wake up in the morning, all my wounds from the day before are gone. Not even a scratch on my little toe. Why do these animals want to hurt me so bad? What have I done to deserve this fate? All I know anymore is fighting. The struggle. But we aren\u2019t struggling for a purpose, we\u2019re just here. No one else has ever peered in to our forest, no Devil, no God. Just myself, and a million animals who want nothing more than to see me dead.", "But I can\u2019t die. ", "I\u2019ve tried.", "The words \u201cFINAL ROUND\u201d scrolled across the bright marquee hanging from the ceiling of the arena, and the crowd became abruptly silent, the echoes of the last cheer reverberating against the walls. The lone man in the corner held a hunting rifle, but was otherwise unequipped for hunting, dressed only in streetclothes: a faded t-shirt, sneakers that were probably once white. He looked up and saw his opponent, made out a figure in the opposing corner. ", "His body stiffened. In the opposing corner was himself. Another version of himself, like the one he saw in the mirror when he brushed his teeth (in his living moments), but this time not flipped. The man thought of how, looking at pictures of himself, there had always been a moment of misrecognition: No, I part my hair the other way; my mole is on my left ear. Breaking the faraway standoff, the doppelganger moved forward in a slow walk, rifle in hand, but not at the ready.", "The man raised his weapon at the advance, but could not get his hands to stay still. It was like the first time his father let him hold a gun on a hunting trip. His father taught him gun safety, how to hold a rifle, how to wait for a deer, and shoot. Without his father here to steady his aim, he struggled to keep the grip from slipping.", "When the doppelganger was within comfortable speaking range, he smiled, and spoke for the first time. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d", "The man replied, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have your gun up? I\u2019m go\u2014I\u2019m going to try to kill you.\u201d", "\u201cAre you, now?\u201d The copy snickered. \u201cI thought we were going to do a duet or something. Just like in colour guard at Davidson? Except you\u2019d have someone to actually do a duet with this time \u2018round. We didn\u2019t have the best of luck with finding partners, now did we?\u201d He twirled the rifle around a bit.", "The man kept staring, unmoving from his corner, kept holding up his rifle half-ready to shoot. \u201cStop it. I\u2019m pointing a gun at you. How can you be joking when someone\u2019s pointing a rifle at you like this? How can you be calm in a situation like this?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018cause I know you don\u2019t have the balls to pull the trigger. I\u2019m you, remember?\u201d", "The man flinched.", "\u201cYou only got that exterminator job because the boss owed your family. That little voice in your head that you think people don\u2019t hear? You vocalise everything it says; it\u2019s because you talk to yourself on the train that people give you the side-eye. You\u2019re just too stupid to figure it out. I know everything that you do and more. And I know I won\u2019t need this.\u201d The doppelganger dropped his rifle on the floor. It clattered for a bit before coming to rest shortly, the loudest sound since the match started.", "The man\u2019s eyes widened, and he took a step back, but his copy just took two steps forward.", "\u201cYou hardly deserved to live and you hardly deserved to die. You fail at everything. Remember the time you laughed at that guy because you thought he was joking when he said he was going into modelling?

You couldn\u2019t even shoot a guy if he was standing two feet away, huh?\u201d\nThe man closer to the centre of the arena punched the farther one in the chest, causing him to fall to the floor, dropping his gun on the way down. The one still standing rubbed his knuckles on his shirt.", "The man on the floor felt the wind get knocked out of him, and had only managed to recover enough to prop himself up on one arm before the clone pushed him down again with the sole of his sneaker.", "\u201cDoes this seem familiar?\u201d The copy forcefully brought his foot down on the man\u2019s ribcage.", "\u201cDid you scream like a girl?\u201d He kicked the crumpled man from the side.", "\u201cDid he call you faggot?\u201d Kick.", "\u201cPoofter?\u201d Kick.", "\u201cFairy?\u201d Kick.", "The man on the floor coughed and wheezed, felt drops of something warm on his forearm.", "The man above him paused, breathing raggedly and standing above his victim, before bending down to turn him so that they were face-to-face, and choking him, snuffing out what life was left. He offered little resistance, pawing weakly at the hands around his neck before falling limp.", "The man took his hands off the corpse\u2019s neck and watched as the body faded away like those of the insects and game before it, then looked up to see confetti falling from somewhere above, like light rain.", "I store up at the giant wave of fur and chitin, wondering if hell was /really/ that bad.

She had the options of heavier armor, but she figured the lighter armor would keep her nimble. The keepers here could conjure any sort of arms and armor that she could conceive. ", "Her first cheeky attempt at requesting something ludicrous, say a tank for example, was met with a pointed \"No\". She hated that moment. Not because an ethereal being from purgatory had dismissed her handily. That was easily the least of her worries.", "It was what the tone betrayed beneath it.", "It wasn't the exasperated \"no\" of a retail employee who had answered the same question one time too many. It wasn't the furrowed brow and irritated tones of a humorless middle manager in some software development company somewhere.", "It was a habitual response that found no humor, joy, sorrow, bemusement, nothing at all. There was nothing there. Everything currently happening to her was a process with natural immutable rules, like a change of season or an ocean current.

Dead inside. ", "Four more. Various insects. She gasped for air and humanity against the corpse of a beetle. The usually disinterested crowd that was there out of obligation -their role in the process- murmured at the young scrappy woman still alive somehow despite six consecutive battles. It turned into a boisterous cheer.", "Something flickered in the depths of who she was. It wasn't a scorch that brought her back to life. The apathy had snuffed out what it could. But somewhere down there it was flickering, barely holding on, just like her. ", "A few more battles. The insects stopped entertaining the crowd, so they started moving into the smaller rodents. Mice and rats and the like. She had noted the sideways glances of the keepers during her off time. ", "Curiosity! ", "Her recent victories had lit a blaze and force of will in her she wasn't sure she even had known in life. But the crowd's deafening approval could only spark so much. But the notion that the resigned keepers, whom were the embodiment of the process, had been made different through her. The thought made that light into a powerful inferno.", "And so brings us to today. The day prior she had made short work of the largest rat available. They would move onto the larger vermin such as Possums and Raccoons today. Scars painted her bare arms like a tapestry of warfare. It was a macabre bit of symbolism, but it was a chronological map of her will to become who she was in this moment, sitting in the dusty interior of a gladiator cell with no significant anxiety but the thrill pounding with each pulse of blood through her veins.", "The cell keeper came. A bald fellow with pale blonde eyebrows that made them difficult to see. He was dressed in pale blue robes that gathered the dust of the cobblestone floor as it brushed along. ", "He unlocked the gate and swung it open, stepping aside for her and her spear in the process. \"My dear\" he said warmly like he did before every battle. She didn't know his name yet, but he almost got him to tell her once. It just gave her more motivation to survive the raccoon out there. She could never know his name from one of Hell's nine circles (She had verified the nine circles were real. One of the other keepers had spilled that bit of trivia).

Hell I was already doing it for free. There is something about watching life leave the eyes of an animal. It was the only thing that genuinely brought a smile to my face.

But sometimes you can get away with a little treat.", "It's like masturbating you see? If it we're legal, and socially acceptable, would you go around public jerking off into all the pretty ladies little dolled up faces? Can you imagine the orgasmic orgies that would happen, the jizz would be flying all over the place. Facial after facial. Now replace all the sex with killing instead, and the climax is when the life leaves the eyes of my dance partner. It's an unattainable dream unfortunately, better to hold off for lesser prey so that I can keep going. Now I could only manage to kill 3 people in life, before it started getting real suspicious. So I backed off, because I can always kill animals, and I even got paid for it!", "The being floated gently to the ground and withdrew its hood, showing the face of a young boy with jet black hair and almond shaped eyes. It was one of the boys I had killed!", "\"I understand Clancy, thank you for the explanation. My death  at your hands makes sense. It seems to me that you we're born like this, born with the undeniable need to kill\".", "Clancy stood staring at the boy, the cat had got his tongue this time.", "\"Yes, it uh, it wasn't my fault\"! Clancy looked away, yup still surrounded by that bright fog. He had been walking through that fog for what felt like a year, stumbling, sometimes coming across the bones of those who gave up. Never rest was the rule here. It's why all those damned skeletons littered the ground here, if they stop to rest then they wither away. They always stared at him, it kind of drove him mad.", "\"Wait, I don't even know your name boy\"", "\"Silence! you never bothered to learn my name in the mortal realm before you killed me, why learn it now. This was your second trial Clancy. After the walk of willpower, the ascended always get first dibs on confronting their killer, and they have the final choice in the matter. I was your first trial, and I have the choice, I can purge your soul through holy fire by the will of god, or I can let you move on to face your other trials. Heaven is constructed for the individual. You will live out eternity with the ultimate freedom of choice. Is this something that you would like to do Clancy, would you like to attempt to make it to Heaven\"?", "\"Why I do believe so, yes yes, I think I deserve heaven. God made the earth pretty shitty for me, so I want his finest treatment\".", "\"Then I forgive you, good bye Clancy, and good luck in your final trial\".", "The ethereal being began to fade.", "\"But wait! What is my final trial\"?", "As the boy disappeared into the mist, his voice softly echoed out.", "\"To face the remainder of those you have killed in life, the other half, the ones who are damned, or the ones who never had a soul to begin with\"!", "Suddenly the mist cleared, and Clancy was standing in a field of grass and those lovely purple flowers he used to pick all the time as a kid. He could see a dark shape off in the horizon, with a low barely audible rumble. It was like it was some kind of stampede\n He was slightly allergic to pollen, and he began to sneeze uncontrollably as his eye began to swell and tear up. Snot dribbled down his nose and he could no longer even see the horizon as his vision blurred. ", "He tried to wipe his eyes with the inside of his shirt, but he just smashed bugs into his eyes. Mosquitoes by the millions were now surrounding him. He swatted at them in futility. Every slap he made toward his body killed hundreds, but thousands replaced him. He had wished he never helped exterminate them from those Florida swamps during the Zika virus scare.", "The rumbling grew closer, and he squinted his eyes trying to focus on what was coming. He could make out animals of all different sizes and shaped, all hideously, half rotten and undead. These are the damned and the soulless that the boy was talking about!", "He heard the shrill voice of his ex wife screaming over the now thunderous rumble of the stampede.", "\"Here we come Clancy! Run, run, you brainless twit, you never know, you might escape, take my advice and try to be positive for a change\"!", "Those were the last words I had spoken to my wife as I ran her down and stabbed her repeatedly in the back. Now she said them back to me, sending chills down my spine. \nShe was riding my prize catch, a grizzly bear I had hunted with my .44. A mother bear, especially ferocious. Surrounding her was what seemed like all the mid size creatures I had killed. Raccoons, cats, dogs, rats, possums. ", "Clancy was focused too much off in the distance, he hadn't noticed the giant swarm of vermin at his feet. They crawled up his legs and began biting every square inch of his body. He rolled on the ground, but it was futile. He felt  a stab of pain in his right leg as his wifes makeshift spear stabbed into him. He looked up and seen her skeletal maw beaming at him. A twisted smile for vengeful death.", "\"Why don't you smile more Clancy, try to be a more positive person, it's the secret to life\"!\n She jumped on his chest and bit off his face as the rest of his body was devoured by the vermin and creatures he had once exterminated. He felt every morsel of his flesh being torn and chewed, right until the bones were picked clean. There he lay, as the mist grew thick overhead. Even though his eyes were plucked out by those crows he had killed as a boy, he could still see. He laid there for what seemed like an eternity, but never at rest, just damned and cold.", "Out from the mist he could see a ragged, tired man walking. He then heard a voice come from out of the mist.", "\"Why have you spent your life killing god's creatures\"?", "Clancy saw himself, standing there confronted by an Ethereal being in a white hood cloak. He watched his old self look back at him. He looked back up when the Ethereal being asked him again.", "\"So I have to kill every animal and insect I ever killed?\"", "\"Yeah.\" God boomed. I really didn't want to do this.", "\"How many?\"", "\"780\"", "\"Just... all at once?\"", "\"Yep\"", "\"What's my weapon?\"", "\"You get a choice between Molotov Cocktails or your extermination gear.\"", "\"Where do the-\"", "\"They just appear 1 second after throwing.\"", "\"I'll take the Molotovs.\" I sighed and gripped it tightly as the gate opened.", "\"FIGHT!\"", "\"That's a lot of spiders. Time for revenge on behalf of Australia.\" I let loose with the first Molotov.

The odds were stacked against me but I thrived in it all my life , from birth to death and beyond.", "After a few moments , I heard a spine chilling roar coming from the darkness at the far end of the colosseum , I gripped the sword tightly and faced the monster that burst forth.", "Two little blessings in disguise.", "The first was his choice to become a vegetarian when he was just five years old. It had made him the laughing stock of his little Texas town, from kindergarten up to highschool: a boy who didn't eat meat - 'are you queer son?'", "But he persisted. No mammal or fish or bird had ever passed his teeth since. And no mammal or fish or bird had entered the arena. ", "(Besides one chicken that appeared to be very drunk.) ", "In his mind he was so happy that he wouldn't have to wrestle cows, pigs, horses, rabbits, coyotes or whatever they stuff into hamburgers. He almost forgot why he was there, what he had done in his life and why chosing a career would also affect the afterlife. ", "Almost.", "A giant brown wave of cockroaches appeared in front of him, reaching high above his head, about to crash before his feet. It would form a vast sea of crawling bugs, reaching his knees, about to devour him with those billions of jaws, stripping him of his skin and flesh, sucking his blood drop by drop, eating the splinters of his bones. ", "But then he realised his second blessing, another reason for being bullied in his childhood town in Texas. He took a deep breath, snapped his fingers and tap-danced his way to heaven.", "Exhausted, I drop my shield and crumple to a heap on the ground. I'm completely drained. My side hurts from the bite I took from a snake I had to burn alive; the thing just wouldn't die, and the owner of the house was desperate. We formulated a plan to trick it, to force it outside; I was waiting with the makeshift flamethrower I'd cobbled together the night before.", "That snake put up a fight, but that was the 15th round of 16 rounds; some were harder than the rest, to be sure, but this fight with the snake was a doozy. The fourth round saw me go against a horde of rats; I'd cleaned them out of a house that once belonged to an extreme hoarder. Easily the most disgusting thing I ever had to do as the neighbourhood pest control guy. I relived everything about that house; the smell, the mounds of garbage everywhere, the caked-on grime on the walls... the whole bit. When those rats came at me in full force, the PTSD I never knew I even had came for me. I barely survived that round.", "Round eight was equally as terrifying: wasps. A stubborn nest that had been built up for literally years at the side of a house - somehow five owners never even saw it - was, at the time, the biggest thing I'd run into. I called for backup. It was as if the wasps were expert tacticians, keeping one step ahead of my partner and I in a game of survival of the fittest. It took us four days to conquer the wasps; the family had to stay out of the house for a week afterward due to the sheer amount of fumigation that was needed.", "By round thirteen, I wasn't sure I was going to win it all. But here I am, round sixteen, yet to face my biggest challenge. Everything hurts. My vision is getting blurry. My legs won't work. My shield feels like the heaviest thing in the world. If I win, glory awaits in the skies. If I lose... the fires of Hell are my consolation prize.", "A buzzer sounds, signifying that the rest period is over. I've battled the most fearsome creatures of my career as an exterminator... what could possibly be next?", "The door at the other end of the arena opens, and for a hushed moment, nothing comes out. A rumble emits from the darkness beyond. I pick up my shield and take out my battered sword, ready for anything.", "Then it comes: line by line, a legion of Asian long-horned beetles. My immediate thought is one of triumph: while certainly annoying, these beetles aren't very harmful in terms of defending themselves. I laugh at the fallibility of my foes; this will be easy.", "But my triumph quickly turns to shock when the beetles suddenly grow in size, develop razor-sharp blades on their limbs, and sprout menacing-looking gun turrets from their backs. The first wave faces me from the other end of the arena, poised to attack. All I have is a sword and shield. That won't be enough.", "\"Would you like to change your weapon load out, sir?\"", "The voice came from the loudspeaker behind me. I turn around abruptly, and see a spread of various weapons laid out on a table: guns, crossbows, various blades, and other explosive weapons. I drop my sword and shield and grab an armful of grenades, turning back to face the giant beetles and dropping them at my feet. I pull the pin on one of the grenades, and an evil grin flashes across my face.", "If I'm going down, I'm going down in a blaze of glory.", "\u201cBut I\u2019m a Buddhist!\u201d Most details of my life are foggy now and fading fast but I find this fat piece of truth, and I cling to it.

His mouth was dry and he couldn't remember how he got here. He could remember his life. His wife, his kid his friends in the alley and all the great times they spent in the lazy Texas afternoons. He rubbed his head as he moved toward the bright archway at the far side of this dark cave. \"Cave\" he thought \"how the hell did I get into a cave...\" \"I need a smoke\" he mumbled as he searched for his pack. A sudden panic came over him \"WHERE ARE MY SMOKES\" he exclaimed as he stepped into the light. It was a blinding and dazzling whiteness that took his vision for a moment. As his eyes adjusted he could see the brightness, feel the brightness emanating from a figure on a throne at the end of, of this arena? \"Why am I in an arena\" he thought as he looked around at the silent and somber crowds packed into the stands. Some were breathtakingly beautiful while others were the stuff of his deepest nightmares. All were focused on him with a cold indifference. They were not here for fun or taking any enjoyment from it. It was more like a job. Dale was reminded of the exterminator convention in Tuscaloosa that he attended. The people in their overalls that didn't care about anything but death. The people who were so desensitized by killing they spoke of it with indifference. It wasn't a desire, it wasn't fun it was a job like any other. For Dale it was different. He was full of passion for life and his work.\nHe look to the figure on the throne, not man not woman but both and neither at the same time. \"Weird\" he muttered under his breath. A voice erupted around him, even though it had no origin \"DALE YOU HAVE LIVED A LIFE PAID FOR BY THE DEATH OF MY CREATIONS.THE LIVES YOU HAVE TAKEN HAVE BEEN MARKED, THIS IS YOUR JUDGEMENT.\"\n\"Huh, no shit\" Dale stated \"What are we getting into?\" he asked the presence.\n\"WE WILL GIVE A CHANCE FOR REDEMTION THROUGH BLOOD, YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF THE ENEMY OF THOSE WHO CRAWL,SLITHER AND SLINK. THEY WILL HAVE THE SAME OPPERTUNITY AGAINST YOU\"\n\"YOU WILL BE AFFORDED THE SAME WEAPONS AS IN LIFE\"\nTHOSE WHO SURVIVE WILL GO TO ETERNAL BLISS AND THOSE WHO FAIL SHALL BURN\"\nDale felt the familiar weight of his sprayer materialize on his back, he could tell from the weight it was full. A smile crept to his face as he saw the millions of little eyes in the entrance across from him. He looked to the being with one thought on his mind and a swelling joy in his heart. Reaching back he grasped his trust sprayer wand and asked \"before we start, could I bum a smoke?\"", "I was 17 when I crossed the road. The last thing that I remember is the sound of screeching tyres and the distant noise of sirens approaching while I watched the blood stain the road.", "I woke up on the floor of a circular room, with a barrier separating my half from the other half of the circle.", "I had never even considered the possibility of life after death, yet I'm here.", "The silence was shattered by an unfamiliar voice, telling me that I was about to have a fight to the death with every soul that I had ever taken in my life.

Sure I've killed a few wasps and spiders, but no deadly species live in the UK so I should be fine right?", "The voice tells me I have ten seconds left. I stand there waiting there to be attacked by a cocktail of small English wildlife.", "The last second gets counted and the barrier disappears.", "I stand there in disbelief, staring into not only the eyes of a few birds and squirrels, but also the eyes of five large cows, ten pigs, fifty or so chickens, a few baby sheep and a deer.", "I scream at the top of my lungs \"What the fuck?!? I've never killed any of this what is happening?!\"", "There was no reply.", "It only took me a minute to figure out why though.", "The animals weren't doing anything aggressive. They just looked like they're enjoying the extra space of my half of the room.", "Hours went by as I sat there watching a load of farm animals walk around aimlessly, swatting off mosquitos and the odd wasp.", "Then the reality set in that the only way to get out of here was to kill every living thing in the room.", "I started with the chickens, it took hours to chase each one individually but once they were caught their necks broke with surprising ease. I couldn't keep my eyes open though, the sounds were bad enough.", "Now time for the lambs, luckily there were no adult sheep to protect them, unlike the cows that were shielding the few calfs that were there.", "I crept up on one and picked it up by the leg, shorty before I swung it's body as hard as I could against the wall.

I lift up my leg ready to kick it's head in, as I had no other way to kill the poor thing.", "I pushed the lambs face into the ground and closed my eyes before kicking it once in the back of the head. I felt the shatter of broken bones through my leg. Finally silence again.", "I took this opportunity to rest, I fell asleep a few hours later along with some of the other animals.", "I woke up to the sound of something scraping along the floor next to me. I took me a moment to realise that the kick that was meant to kill the lamb clearly did not. I look up and stare into a broken face, just blood, no eyes, every inch of it's white coat stained the same shade of red that flooded the asphalt once before.", "This is when I realised that there was no way out. I couldn't kill another like that, it was just too much.", "I picked up one of the chickens that I had killed earlier. I ripped it's wing off and snapped the bone to give it a sharp pointed tip.", "I stuck this bone into the artery of my right arm, and pulled it downwards slicing the little tube open from my elbow to my wrist. All it took was five minutes. My last sight was the pigs lapping up the blood around me.", "Now I'm awake once again. The same room. The same voice. The same wall.", "The wall disappears, but this time the only animal standing there looking me in the eye was me.", "\"We have an exterminator with us today boys and girls!\"", "The croud begins to chant \"Bug Show\" over and over again.", "\"I can do this.

Who would have thought that a stampede of cockroaches, acting as a single organism, had such a strength that they brought down the pillar on which he stood five minutes before with ease. ", "He facepalmed himself, thinking about his stupidity earlier: Had he chosen the flamethrower that was amongst the armoury he had been presented with, he now might stand a chance. Instead he had just started to laugh into the old guys face, not believing what he had told him. Pinching his arm would have no consequence, he knew that this wasn\u2019t a dream. That he apparently must have died when that truck suddenly stepped out of line and approached him without hitting the breaks soon enough. ", "Now he was dead, that was certain.

No, this isn\u2019t the scenario that always comes to your mind when you think about what happens after drawing your last breath on earth. You\u2019d think there was an old guy at a golden gate with a nice ornament and behind the gate perhaps a stairway leading upwards. At the end you could see a heart-warming source of light and perhaps Eden, some angels with little harps flying around. Perhaps the old guy would read a bit from the book in front of him, what you did during your life, the good, the bad, and perhaps some of the ugly as well. But then you were granted access into God\u2019s paradise, whether or not you\u2019ve believed in him during your lifetime.

I didn't think there could be with all the shit that's happened in my life. Countless sufferings I've endured throughout it all. How could there be a God in such a shit world. A world where a parent dies giving birth to her only son. A world where a father is allowed to keep a child despite still being deeply affected by the death of his wife and turning to booze. A world where CPS sees nothing wrong with the bruises or the child's living conditions which contains not a single toy for the child to play with. Instead of toys the child turns to torturing bugs which run rampant in the tiny apartment that CPS deemed as \"good enough.\" A child who is bullied by other kids over the fucking over sized thrift shop clothes, bought on the 75% off days where the clothing options are more limited due to them restocking the next day, that he wears. Also bullied to the fact that during recces no one would go near him let alone play with the kid so he would play in the mud with the worms and ants that live there. Perhaps everyone saw it coming that \"bug boy\" himself would become an exterminator. Not just bugs though, rats, raccoons, the occasional possum or two. I mean who expected more from him? Not his father of course, he died years before I got the job. Last thing I remember of him telling me is if I can drive his old man to the hospital, claiming he had extreme pain in his upper right chest area or something. I still remember his yellowing skin and eyes looking at me, in pain and with fact that he knew I wouldn't. He was holding onto the photo of my mother before they were married. I snatched that photo away and I left home that day, he stayed there and died on the couch. I found myself in New York city, with nothing but $20 in my pocket and a few pairs of dirty clothes I changed into every couple of days. I tried begging and finding work to no avail. Finally found a job that was in high demand and required little training, exterminating. Everyday something new and crazy. An entire apartment complex, an office on the 76th floor, even in the million dollar hipster homes in Brooklyn no where was free of pest in New York and I loved it. Sorta got a thrill from killing bugs and animals and shit. After a few years didn't get any thrill from trapping a family of rats and suffocating them in my plastic bag. Bugs were nothing to me, just things to be stepped on. Then it occurred to me that I might of mastered the art of killing pests and that I should try to move onto bigger fish. I quit work, after working there for so long working harder and longer then anyone else I had made a fairly large sum of money. It would last me a few months a year if I planned accordingly. I figured I start off small. A kid, would be a prefect starting point. So I went to the park, and picked out my target. A young girl, maybe 6 or 7. No parents or adults in sight. I went for it. I quickly crossed the street, running straight towards the child. I picked her up and tried to cover her mouth while heading back to my van. \n\"HELP, MOM! MOMMYY.\"\nI look back to the park searching to see if anyone noticed the screaming as a I cross the street. I hear beeping of a car as I turn and see a truck ram right into me. Pitch blackness.\nI wake up almost instantly. I feel like I'm laying on a cloud. I stand up uneasily.", "\n\"NOW LET THE GAMES BEGIN!\"\nBooms a large voice from the sky, and cheers echo around me. I turn around to see a large gate open. \nRats, possums, roaches, ants, raccoons, mice, pigeons, and spiders rush towards me at full speed. They take me down, begin covering my entire body. biting my body and entering my ears. I scream in pain, before I pass out I see my mother and father ripping at my throat.

Just like he'd gotten used to the flashing camera's and book signings. It had been a month since he'd given the seeds to the world. Now he could hardly avoid the camera's and fame. Pushing his way through what seemed like a sea of blinding cameras and yelling reporters, Trevor made his way to the Uber he had called for. Time to go take a shower!", "After slamming the door to the car, the driver gave him a mirrored double take. \"You're that Trevor guy, aren't you? You know, curing cancer saved my life! I have you to thank!\" Trevor didn't say anything. He couldn't. He knew it wasn't him who deserved the credit. Well... technically it was...", "He left an offended driver a generous tip and headed up to his 2nd story Flat. His shower was already running when he arrived. He immediately stripped off his clothing and reverently crouched at its entrance.", "\"May I enter, oh holy one?\" A deep bellow of steam tumbled out of the door, and a wave of comforting heat caudled his body, saving it from the cold air of the bathroom. He crawled in on all fours. Immediately the world went black.", "He found himself in a very familiar place. This was his third time here, but it felt like he lived here already. \"Where are you, my liege?\" Looking down at his hands, he saw that they were fully visible, even though he couldn't see anything as far as his eyes could pierce. It was as though he were standing in broad daylight, even if his surroundings were in the deepest and darkest of shadow.", "Before long, the crystal came into view. It hovered towards him at an anxiously rapid speed. It glowed an amber color, even though its surface was blue. As it approached, Trevor was worried that it might not stop this time. It's apparent pilot was a little off his rocker to begin with...", "It stopped abruptly, staggering Trevor and causing an audible burst. Trevor stood tall and did what he had done twice before. He laid a hand upon it. Immediately a hand sprang from near where his was placed and gripped his forearm. It pulled itself free from the crystal, slowly crawling its way towards his elbow. Boney fingers and white flesh hidden by the arm of a robe made its way to his bicep. The robes were exactly what Trevor would envision a man of this sanity to wear. Bright sky blue with white stars across every inch. They really didn't match the face which came into view. Caucasian, slightly messy brown-going-grey hair covered by a tall wizard hat of the same c, it was a kind face. Gentle even. His eyes were a sharp contrast to the sane gentle demeanor present in his body. They were entirely white, save for pinpricks of pupils staring directly at his. Even though the mans face was calm, the eyes held such intensity that Trevor could hardly bear to look at them.", "\"I hate it when you call me that. I'm a Wizard. Not a king. I was a king... will be a king...? What year is it when you're from?\"", "Trevor had enough of the wizard to understand not to question a question. \"2017\" he said simply.

Vulnerable in the simplest way, yet safely insulated from the outside world. The white noise of the water's pitter-patter on my skin spurred some of my best self-reflections and calming moments.", "The first weird thing happened the morning of March 7th. As soon as I had stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel, I felt an urge to go back in. I'm normally reluctant to end a good shower, but this was almost uncontrollable. In fact, I had almost made it back in when my phone alarm went off, reminding me that I would be late to work if I didn't leave within 10 minutes. That had already happened twice in the past week, so I couldn't afford another. So I left, and didn't think much of it.", "The same thing happened the next day: shower, end of shower, powerful urge to re-enter the shower, alarm, self-control. But this time I was more cognizant, and vowed to investigate more later.", "So that night, after I had eaten dinner, I took another shower. Nothing abnormal happened during it, but as before, it came as I exited. Taking careful mental notes, I went back in and turned the water on. At first, nothing seemed different, but then I noticed that quite a few conspicuously large drops had hit the glass door. As I watched, they trickled down (some in physics-defying ways) until I could make out a message. Most of it was gibberish to me - equations, formulas, and other nonsense - but I tried to memorize as much of it as I could.", "After I was confident that I could remember it all, I exited the shower again (no urge this time) and went to go write down what I had seen. I live alone, so clothes could wait until I knew I had gotten it all. When I did go back to dress, it seemed like the door was now uniform with mist. All the writing had been erased in the span of a few minutes.", "For a while, the strange writing stayed on my table, private proof of a private anomaly. But that changed when my friend Rhys came over for dinner a week later. This had been spurred by inexplicable feelings in the shower, not as I had left it. Rhys was some kind of doctor, and we had remained good friends despite our different jobs.", "When he caught a glimpse of the notes I had made, he picked it up idly and began to read. He got more and more excited as he got through it, until he straight-up ran out of my apartment before I had even finished cooking. I tried to call him to see what had happened, but he either ignored my calls or replied that he was too busy to talk to me properly. I next saw him the afternoon of March 26; when he arrived on my front door, it was with countless reporters and scientists at his side.", "You've probably heard the rest of the story; as it turns out, those scribbles that had been meaningless to me had turned out to be the key to curing cancer. I was lost, but the reporters took my confusion for humility and didn't really grasp what had transpired until Rhys sat me down and explained.", "A few weeks later, a similar sequence of events transpired. I knew well enough to obey the urge when it came over me, and writing appeared on the door again. I wrote it down and this time, mailed it to my state's Senators. They ultimately used the seemingly meaningless information to end world hunger.", "I was now a celebrity, but deserved or wanted none of it. The populace just assumed I was a shy and eccentric genius, but a genius I was not.", "I haven't told anyone that I didn't actually come up with that information. It's been about a month again since my last \"breakthrough\", and now people of all different occupations are clamoring for my attention. I don't know what will come next, or what powers are behind it. All I know is that it has disrupted my entire life and given me everything that I never wanted. I was happy with my mediocre yet fulfilling and private life.", "I used to love showering. But not anymore.", "Now I know that every shower is another chance for me to simultaneously receive false praise and overwhelming pressure to top my previous achievement.", "It had taken months of searching, but he decided it had all been worth it. Medical facilities with a private bathroom and shower facilities were certainly hard to come by. He closed his eyes, plugged his ears, and tipped his head back into the stream of water to bask in the roar that soothed out the stresses of the day.", "\"Cancer...\" a voice whispered through the rolling drums of pounding water. \"The cure... You must... So... Simple...\"", "He jerked his head forward and shook the water from his face. \"Who? Where?\" He gasped, but realized he was in fact alone. Curious, hopeful, he tipped his head back again, slower this time. When the sound of water was but a gentle spring rain in his thoughts, he heard. He smiled to himself as the water told him of the new wonders he would work.", "\"Morning Julie,\" he called as he strolled passed his secretary and into his office. She was silent as ever, a dedicated worker and successful patient as well. \n\"Forty seven,\" he said aloud to himself.\n\"Two months of testing and treatment and we have succeeded forty seven times.\nHe sat down at his desk and turned to the large window behind it. Picking a glass from a small cabinet beneath the window, he poured a glass of a strong scotch and leaned back I his chair. He decided not to let the gloomy view of the day dampen his mood, and downed the liquor with a practiced ease.", "\"All these patients, people, that I shall help. My name shall be on every lip. He who stopped the march of cancer. He who took the fear of coming days from their minds. He who stopped the pain and frustration with just a single shot.\" ", "He chuckled, pleased with his monologue, and got to work. Turning on his lights and equipment, he positioned all he would need and began the mixing process. Something that achieved such results took seemingly little time and effort to make. Quite amazing no one had thought of it before. A few hours work and he had completed another sixty doses. He would have a full schedule this week. So many patients, people, to save.", "He turned off his equipment, locking and securing all but the dose he would need for today's patient. Grabbing up his case, he headed for his linen closet and donned a fresh set of scrubs. They were dark, things seemed to stay cleaner that way.  With fresh gloves and mask, he headed down the hall to see the patient.", "\"No... No no no oh god no please no no...\" stemmed from the patients mouth. They cried, they screamed, always to nervous and unbelieving that they had been chosen to be cured. This one was younger than most, twenty five, perhaps thirty. Fit and strong, at least to judge by the way she struggled against the restraints on the bed.", "\"Ssshhhh, it's alright now.\" he soothed into her endless babbles and screams. \"Your dose is here, it's time.\"", "He placed his hand on her arm to steady her, and quickly gave her the full dose. Her screaming rose to a crescendo, but quickly began to fade off. A mild shiver, a rolling of the eyes, a foul stench, and it was done.", "He smiled, patting the corpse on the arm before standing. ", "\"There now, that cancer shall never bother you again my dear. Doctors promise.\"", "Striding down the hall and back to his office he stopped to tell Julie of another success. She was quiet, dead quiet, as always. How else sound she be? The dried skeletal grin upon her face showing how she had appreciated being his first patient.", "He undressed quickly in his office, and stepped into his shower to relax. The water was a bit cool again, but what would you expect in an abandoned nursing home. He'd fix it tomorrow.", "He closed his eyes, plugged his ears, and tipped his head back. He listened long to the whispers in the water, until.", "\"Yes... Yes of course. Of course!\" He shouted. \n\"If it works for cancer, it shall solve hunger too! Afterall,  the dead shall need no food.\"", "(Wrote on mobile, hope formatting not terrible) ", "With trepidation, John Rowe slowly turned the chrome plated knobs on the wall. The rounded shower head burst to life, angrily spewing hot water like a vomiting drunkard. Creeping tendrils of mist began to work their way up and out of the bathtub, crawling over the floor of the bathroom towards him. Reaching. Yearning. Fighting an almost overwhelming instinct to run, he let his battered towel drop to the floor, and slowly stepped into the tub. As the steaming water hit his head, it seemed to desperately crawl over him, enveloping him in a wet, malign grasp. Then the voice, a shard of ice in his mind, as cold as the water was hot, spoke again.", "After the first time, he had only waited three months before stepping back in. The experience had been dreadful, and afterwards he slept for two days, but it was also addictive. Even while he was distracted with promoting Sudenulon, being interviewed by pretty blonde journalists, or posing for photoshoots with world leaders, a constant buzz in the back of his mind was always urging him to return for a second hit. He made his way back whilst in town for a piece with the local school newspaper. That time it took him a whole week to recover. It played havoc with his diary, and he had more than one angry call from the publicist. Of course, that all melted away once he told them about the Manna Project. He'd planned to return sooner for a third hit, but that all changed when he was asked to address the UN.", "John had been reserved a seat on a passenger jet to New York. It was an extremely comfortable ride in first class, and the attendants were falling over themselves to meet his needs. It was whilst he was chewing on an extremely succulent roasted duck that he felt the crunch, followed by the warm taste of blood in his mouth. He quickly rose and headed to the bathroom. ", "After locking the door, the cold fluorescent lights flickered on. He spat into the sink, and nestled amongst a mixture of blood, saliva, and the remains of his meal, was one of his molars. In the light of the airplane toilet, the tooth had an almost ceramic quality to it. It reminded him of bathtiles. After rinsing his mouth with some water, he reached inside with his thumb, and found the empty socket. Except that it wasn't empty. As he probed around, he felt a sharp sting. He pulled his thumb back out, and on the tip, a small drop of blood was beginning to appear. Looking in the mirror as he did so, he pulled the side of his mouth open to get a look. There, sat between the teeth where his molar had previously been, was the thing that had cut him, sharp and pointed. A fang.", "The voice cut through his mind again. The air was heavy with steam now, and with each breath it desperately clawed its way into his lungs. He felt it, crawling around burning hot inside of him, ravenous. The water screaming out of the shower head was starting to flow faster, more impatiently. He knew what to do. Shivering despite the heat, he spoke.", "One month later, John was sat in a hotel suite. Lights and cameras were arranged throughout the room, focused on the ornate wooden chair on which he was sat. In front of him, a man dressed in a tailored blue pinstripe suite was leafing through some paper notes. The man looked up at John.", "\"I think we're about ready Mr Rowe if you are?\"", "John nodded in approval.", "\"Ok then,\" the suited man started, \"I think it's fair to say a lot of our viewers have been quite worried about you. It's been a month since you were last seen in public. What is there to the story that you've spent that entire time meditating, and that's when you came up with this blueprint for a cold fusion reactor?\"", "Looking straight at the camera, John began to speak. \"Well Terry, it's certainly very close to the truth. I have spent a lot of that time soul searching...\"", "He continued talking on autopilot. He was now very used to giving answers to interviewers with very little effort or concentration. Tugging at his shirt cuffs, his mind was elsewhere. He was more concerned with his shirt. The arms felt too short, he could feel them slipping back over his wrists. He decided that he would just have to hold them in place for now, and after the interview had concluded, he would go to find somewhere to buy a new shirt. Longer sleeves. Better fitting. Something that would keep the scales covered.", "\"Did you tell them?\" ", "\"I didn't\" I replied, leaning against the doorway of the bathroom. ", "\"Good. You did good.\" ", "\"I can't..I can't keep this up. The medias watching me. The ceremonies are wearing me down.

Everywhere I go people know me and I haven't had to pay for a meal in months. Yes, it is a feeling like no other.", "This morning I felt a little more thankful of my luck. See 3 months ago I found my shower incepted in my brain the idea of curing cancer and the next month the knowledge to cure world hunger. In three months I became a God. No doubt I will be the most known man in human history. The perks of being a God you might ask. Well one is sleeping next to me. She is a scientist trying to cure diabetes, I think.. I could never really wrap my brain around science stuff anyways. Lucky for me no one cares too much about your background when you're giving them cures. This blonde beauty with looks and a brain is a nightly ritual for me. I usually send them packing in the morning after some breakfast and a round 2 under the sheets. However,  this one I actually feel like seeing again.", "Yes, today I am feeling extra thankful. I think I'll get up and make us some breakfast and coffee. I have to be quiet and surprise her before she wakes up. I've actually gotten good at sneaking out of bed and quietly preparing a healthy breakfast. Today was no different.", "Ah,  a full fridge. It's beautiful to see. I'll quickly prepare this and get it upstairs. ", "As John is preparing breakfast he hears the sound of running water.

He walked into the kitchen and grabbed the sharpest knife he had. Walking upstairs, john could only think about how he was the chosen one to find cures for the world. Afterall it was his shower. He walked into the bathroom took off his clothes and hopped in behind her. The blonde had her eyes closed, but got excited that John had decided to enter the shower with her.

I questioned the reverence of the force behind these acts, and it still endowed a final truth to me.\"", "The detective read the blood spattered note again and again, continuously looking back at the corpse of the man who had single handedly accomplished more in a mere few months than most people would in three lifetimes. His body had been twisted and battered, but the note that had been laid before the mans corpse contradicted the horror before him. His vision began to swim slightly after fixating on the gruesome visage, he forced himself to regain composure and again examine the crime. Through practice, he recited the details of the situation leading up to police receiving a tip. \"Two and a half months ago, a man proclaims to have an efficient cure for cancer, which he brings to a small pharmaceutical company to manufacture and sell at cost; a month after the cure is globalized, he brings the agricultural board a proposal to be sent to any that would like it. The proposal was for a crop rotation schedule that when worked in conjunction over a large area with different climates, could produce more than enough natural food for the world to be fed.. And now a month later we find him like this after receiving an anonymous tip about him being in danger.. Speaking of which-\" the detective looked over his shoulder at his partner, \"Do we have any leads on who gave that tip yet? I can't imagine someone breaking their own spine after all\" a shrug and wagging head said more than enough to the detective, who frowned and faced forward again in response. A moment passed in silence before the detective stiffened and turned to face his partner with every intention of meeting his partners stare, but his eye was instead drawn past him, and directly inside of the bathroom just beyond where his partner was standing. Centered unnaturally in this room was a single shower head attached to a spigot coming from the ceiling, and to the detectives dismay, the rest of the room had been stripped bare. The detectives eyes widened as he clenched the note harder, absent mindedly taking slow steps towards and past his partner, who merely watched silently as he always had. The detective took a final step, positioning him beneath the shower head before realising that he had moved at all, he attempted to turn and face his partner again, but his will was not met by any action, instead an unfamiliar voice filled his inner ears, the feeling of death itself gripped the detective, just as he was gripping the note, \"You have come seeking truth, and so you are tasked with the sacrifice truth requires.\" the detective knew where the voice came from, but could not possibly acknowledge his partner had said it, \"The first was unworthy, truth exacted its cost when he had forsaken it for his vanity, only to repent in the end, like all children. Know now, the truth that will bring redemption to your kind, and spread this truth, as is the cost of knowledge.\" ", "The detective felt a single drop of water hit his forehead.", "-end-", "Gonna be honest, haven't done any writing prompts for a long time, hope someone enjoys it.", "They were suprised when I cured cancer. So suprised they put it under review. They said it was proven to cure, but they need to make sure its safe. So safe they said it will be another 15 years before it can be implemented. I asked why it would take so long, they said it was because it was pushed for review by numerous medical boards. It was only later I learned it was the insurance companies and cancer medical supply corporations lobbying for this. I cured world hunger next, hoping to do some good in this decade. I can't go into detail for legal reasons, but I essentially made traditional food obsolete in the poor regions of the world. As you can imagine the food industry didn't like that. I get death threats on a daily basis. My car exlploded the other day, thank goodness I wasn't in it. We can't prove it was someone from the food industry, but the FBI told me to be careful. They told me this becuase they were trying to interrogate me. They spent hours asking me questions.

Normally he looks like a typical scientist, thoughtful, a bit detached from the world. His anger makes him look so different; he looks like he\u2019s ready to attack.\n\u201cHow long did you know, Ivan?\u201d I asked casually, trying to keep my voice as calm as possible.\n\u201cI had misgivings about you from the very beginning. You seemed intelligent, but not enough to find these cures. I asked around, and no one can remember you to ever to be so remarkable.\u201d\nI repressed a sigh. What he was saying was true. I always had to work hard to achieve good results, and there were many who did far better than me without doing as half as me. I tried to find answers, what actually makes a genius? Does having superior intellect lie in the genes? Or is the secret is diligence? It might be a combination of both. For all I know that there came a time when I accepted defeat. I concurred that nothing \u2013 anything that can change the world \u2013 will ever be invented by me.\nSo after graduating college with an abysmal result it was a time of deep depression. I smoked, I wrote terrible poems which made me more depressed. I was lying in bed, looking at the ceiling of my dingy apartment when I realized that I haven\u2019t showered in two weeks. I had to force myself there, and I vividly remember slipping into daydreaming, thinking about a world where I am a savior, a hero, a person to be worshipped. And then it hit me, it hit me so hard that I had to turn off the shower and gasped, trying not to slip by grasping the wall.\nI wrote it all down, and next day went to meet my old professor. When I started he looked at me pityingly, after two hours he was convinced. And the rest is history. I met Ivan in one of the parties in college, and what struck me as most remarkable is he is very passionate. He had been a child prodigy, and in adulthood he retained his sharp mind unlike many of them. He is the type of person I was always so envious about, but at that party all eyes were on me. The high that I experienced will never come my way again. \nEnough with the memories. Now my secret is out. The satisfaction I will have is that the world has got rid of two of its crucial problems. \n\u201cGo ahead Ivan, tell the world. But first let me know, how did you exactly find out?\u201d\n\u201cYou have everything now, but still you choose to live in this tiny apartment. And then I noticed once that you were very curious about learning mystical properties of water. You said your next project would be to visit those fountains and rivers which are regarded to be magical. I must admit I took a shot at this guess, and turns out I am right.\u201d\nI nodded, he is a very smart person. \n\u201cSo, what are you waiting for? Just go and tell everyone. Don\u2019t wait.\u201d I attempted to smile.\nThe streetlight strangely illuminated the scene, and I thought my eyes are deceiving me. Ivan\u2019s thin, long face suddenly looked dejected, wary.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what I expected\u201d, he said in a low voice.\nWe stood in silence for a long time, and then he went away.

Alien 3 from Alpha Nebulae spoke to me. \"Digger,\" he said, \"You will be stealing my work, but I can transfer the cure for cancer into your head. Do you wish this to happen?\"", "I assented, and then felt the surge of knowledge flying in to my head. All this from a strangely blue-hued-like-mother-of-pearl shower.

So to have a piping hot, steaming shower for once was a miracle.

Jeremy just couldn't hear it quite loud enough to be decipherable alongside the downpour of water... After a while Jeremy got out of the shower- well, tried to get out of the shower. The door was stuck again. He quickly realised the water was still running and thanked the door for some odd reason; as he turned it off the voice became louder, instantly. He jumped- and stubbed his toe on the corner of the shower. Jeremy listened to the shower, it was saying something about curing cancer, it got halfway through the cure -not enough to do anything with and stopped; saying this was \"payback\" for everything he had done, from not getting rid of mould to using cheap shower gel- \"every time you use that, it hurts\" the shower said. \"Come on man can't two dudes just share their ideas with each other?\", \" I think that Donald Trump is... is... GOOD!!!\" Jeremy exclaimed hesitantly.

He would torture the shower.\nHe turned it on full, then back down to nothing- 5 consecutive times he done this, the shower grunted in discomfort. He turned it to hot then cold another 5 times, this time the shower howled in pain and begged him to stop. Then Jeremy took it too far, he pissed in the shower... It immediately continued with the cancer cure.\nAfter it had finished speaking; what must of been an hour worth of lecturing, he got out, dried off and wondered how he would remember everything that had been said. Jeremy never remembers anything... Surprisingly though, even when watching arsenal getting destroyed with his mates, he still remembered.

A few hours later though, He received a letter. The contents were simple, but sweet. Thanking him so much for his amazing cure to cancer that seemed so simple now that it was figured out. They attached a healthy lump of cash, five hundred thousand great british pounds- new, they ruffled with a satisfying sound in his hand when he flicked them. Oh, he also got knighted which wasn't too bad! After this he got so much attention. \"Oh look it's Jeremy Carter!!!\" \"Oh look that's the dude who cured cancer\" \"oh look this\" and \"oh look that\". He liked the attention and the money- for a while; in the space of 3 weeks he had gone from happiness, bliss and enjoyment to agitation, frustration and stress.

After being unsuccessful with the back door, they decided the only way to get out was to sneak around the snake. They took small steps and it was going great. Rens male friend was pissing his pants but besides that they were good. Tip toeing they got outside and a bit away when Ren's idiot friend whispered \"Damn, that was close\"", "The worm woke immediately and started coming after them. Ren thought quickly and told them to hide in the sturdy ABC store. Ren then cut right on to the hardware store porch and did a little jig to attract the worms attention. He barely got the door shut and locked before the worm hit. It left a huge dent but it held for now. He made shitty explosives with gasoline while the worm was circling the building. As the worm circled he did dances in the window. The twist, the jig, the dougie, you name it. ", "As the worm saw this it was as pissed as ever. It started ramming the weak points of the house. Ren had a match in his hand and was ready to do what had to be done. The windows are broken, and the place is caving in. The worm comes around for one more ram that is surely to break through. As the worm starts barreling towards the building, you would think Ren is scared, second guessing himself. He wasn't. He was proud of what he had done and what he stood for. He would love to spend the rest of his life with Ariel, but his love is dance and a life without that wouldn't be a life worth living.

The military is rolling in from all sides, dancing their asses off! Instead of keeping the tremors a secret, the mayor finally told the federal government about this monster and what caused it. The worm was having a sensory overload. It hadn't seen this many dancers ever let alone in every direction. It was curling on the ground like a slug and salt. ", "Blasts came from everywhere. The monster was killed and dancing was ruled legal in the town. Ren and Ariel shared a slow dance among the carnage and military vehicles.

I swallowed the lump in my throat, feigned interest in the grainy footage that I already knew every second of, and excused myself at the first chance I got. Things didn\u2019t get better from there. A day didn\u2019t pass that my name wasn\u2019t smeared across the front page of the newspaper, and I came home each night to a girl that hated every ounce of the hero I was trying to be. I was miserable. ", "So I stopped trying to be a hero. When I learned who she was, why she knew so much, how she knew exactly what to criticize about me and my grand persona, it was too late. In another life, I could be coming home to her. In another life, she could have gotten me training, could have gotten me help with the newly blooming powers that I didn\u2019t know how to control. In this life, though? I tear down skyscrapers and hope she takes notice. ", "I walk home in the rain. I can see the rubble in the back of my mind, mangled steel beams and ruined concrete, and I can\u2019t stomach the guilt. I know what it costs to build something of that scale, and although it soothes my conscience that the hospital was evacuated, I\u2019ve still ruined a resource for a community I know is struggling. The rain is my way of punishing myself - I could make it stop, and even as I trudge forward, the fine curtain of mist parts in front of me, but if I return home soaking wet and catch pneumonia, I reason to myself that I would deserve it. ", "My mind wanders, as I walk, and somehow my feet take me back to the apartment that we shared. I bump into someone, and I look up to apologize, but before I can open my mouth my eyes widen with shock. The words at the tip of my tongue vanish. My mind is spinning with half-coherent thoughts. She shouldn\u2019t be here, it isn\u2019t regulation, does she know that I -\nShe\u2019s not wearing her uniform. If she recognizes me, she gives no indication, and I try my best to do the same. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, her voice soft, and I don\u2019t meet her eyes. I mumble something and try to move on, but she catches my elbow, and the gesture makes me go still. I haven\u2019t touched her in - I don\u2019t want to think about how long I haven\u2019t touched her.", "\u201cDid you know the women who lived here?\u201d She asks me, and I almost laugh at the irony of it all. She doesn\u2019t recognize me. Of course she doesn\u2019t, these days I wear a glamor so heavy most mornings I don\u2019t recognize my new face in the mirror. I could have done this a long time ago, I think, but no, I couldn\u2019t have. She isn\u2019t supposed to be out on a city block like this. She isn\u2019t supposed to be out at all, now that the crisis is over and I\u2019ve already won.", "\u201cA long time ago,\u201d I say. She makes a small sound of assent, and doesn\u2019t move from my side. ", "\u201cOne day she just left,\u201d she says, and I start. There\u2019s no way I can respond to this, but thankfully, she keeps talking. I know that she noticed. She\u2019s being polite, I suppose. \u201cAnd then her partner was recruited, and this street never saw either of them again.\u201d", "I don\u2019t have anything to say. I don\u2019t want to go, though. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve talked to her just like this, no uniform, no rivalry. There is a long, pregnant pause. Finally, she turns to me with a sad smile, and says, \u201cGoodbye, Iris.\u201d", "I want to chase her. Do I? After all these years, she\u2019s finally found a way to tell me what happened to her. Seeing her like this, without that ridiculous red plastered to her hips, makes her loss feel like a fresh wound. Before I can decide, the curtain of rain closes around her, and she\u2019s gone. I know that she wouldn\u2019t want me anyway, now that we\u2019re sworn to different causes, now that she\u2019s legally obligated to destroy me. Still, it hurts like nothing has before. I resolve that I\u2019m going to tear down another building tomorrow, a taller one, all glass and chrome, and immediately hate myself for it.", "As I walk home, I\u2019m suddenly jolted back to reality by the sound of sirens. It\u2019s raining. Nothing should be on fire. And yet I recognize that shrill squeal, and for some reason I find myself breaking into a run. I turn the corner to my apartment. The entire block is in flames, and time seems to stop.", "A courier speeds by me, commissioned by the same agency that regulates superhumans. I can tell by silver wings on his shoes. \u201cNote\u2019s for you,\u201d he says, and he leaves a slightly singed piece of paper in my hands.", "My hands shake as I open it. My building burns, and it seems so distant.", "The rain stops. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see a rainbow, and I allow myself to smile. ", "It was one of those days that made Silvia want to stay in bed and forget anything else existed. She'd been having a lot of those recently. Beside her bed, an ornate fountain gurgled cheerfully. She'd taken it from the garden of some rich family three days ago, and it was starting to look like Agnes wasn't even going to come by and take it back. Any other villain might have been relieved at the thought, but it hurt Silvia more than anything.", "She was just drifting off to sleep when she heard the sharp chime of the entrapment rune she had set on her door. With a groan, she dragged out of bed and into the other room, only to find Agnes of the Silver Moon on the floor, paralyzed.", "\"Silvia,\" she grunted, \"I see you've learned a new trick.\"", "\"What do you mean? That's always been... Oh my god, that thing worked? Oh. My. God. IT WORKED!\" Silvia laughed in an almost hysteric fashion, still struggling to accept the facts of the situation. To be fair, it was the first time something like this had happened to her. In fact, no one had ever managed to capture Agnes like this.", "\"Now, I finally have you right where I want you! Now, I can...\" And then Silvia realized she didn't have any way to imprison Agnes for any amount of time \"I can...\" And then Silvia realized that Agnes could simply blow her away with a single arcane word, while she herself had never managed to learn any actually dangerous spells. \"I can...\" And then Silvia remembered that her henchmen had abandoned her a week ago when she had run out of money. \"I can...\" Finally Silvia realized that there was a very real chance that a stronger dark magic user wouldn't even believe her if she asked for help. And then she started to cry.", "When Silvia got the tears out of her eyes, Agnes had already teleported the fountain back to its rightful place and was standing over her awkwardly, not quite sure how to handle the situation. \"Um, are you okay?\" \"No...\" They were both silent for another minute. \"So, why'd you take that fountain anyway? I don't think it's worth very much.\" \"Because...\" Silvia looked up at Agnes's beautiful brown eyes and stunning complexion, and the truth died in her mouth. \"R-Reasons.\"", "\"Okay, well whatever that means, you don't seem very happy. If you ever wanted to stop stealing things, I could help you start over. I have to go right now though. Someone's been running around with the Heart of the Abyss and I gotta go get it back.\" For a moment, Silvia was stunned out of her misery. \"Wait, the Heart of the Abyss? Do you know what that thing does to people? They could've destroyed three cities in the time we were talking! Why the hell would you stop just to get a stupid fountain back?\" \"Oh you know, reasons.\" With a flash of light, Agnes was gone, leaving Silvia extremely confused. \"What do you mean 'reasons?'\"", "\u201cHi,\u201d she said, through a lopsided smile righted by her slumped posture.", "He let out a long sigh, kneeling down and feeling her forehead. He took off his jacket and slipped it around her, and she pulled it tight. Lifting her up, he got her standing, though couldn't let her go.", "\u201cNo piggyback?\u201d she said with a whiny tone.", "He didn't answer, pulling her forward until her feet gave up their protest and moved forward too.

Without meaning to, one of his thoughts came out. \u201cThen you're the villain.\u201d", "Rather than the cold reaction he expected, she burst into laughter, nearly pulling them both to the floor as she bent over wheezing. When she calmed down enough to speak, she said, \u201cYeah, I totally am.\u201d", "He closed his eyes, and breathed out.

I couldn't see Katherine anywhere. The elixir hadn't worn off yet, it seemed. All I could see was a cloud of dust thrown up where she had landed, and even that was fading quickly. I waited for her to appear.", "When I found myself still standing there an hour later, I knew she was gone. I hoped she was alright. I didn't mean to hurt her. This was all just a misunderstanding. It would work itself out in the end, right?", "Looking back, I couldn't have been more naive.", "\"Detective Frambo, put down your weapon.\"", "\"He requested a transfer, now get down from there and unhand that woman!\"", "\"I see you've tied yourself and the woman to a bomb!

As she left, the fire that shot from her palms propelled her into the sky, a better angle to strategize from. \nShe eyed the cause of her inconvenience. A villain had taken hostage of thirty citizens in clock square.\nFrostbite had iced the entire place so every step was guaranteed to end in failure. Icicles sprouted from the ground, the sharp points aimed at the necks of the faithful denizens of New Terrier City. \nHottie blasted toward the ruckus. \n\"Hey, frost-bitch, its rude to interrupt someone's sleep schedule!\" \n\"Oh hi there hottie, fancy seeing you here\" Frosty accompanied her fretting with a wink. Frosty's hair, streaked white, crazed in all directions and her suit was  as revealing as ever. \n\"Frosty, why do you do shit like this? Did one of the icicles you make get stuck in your ass?\" Hottie snarked, impatient and tired. \n\"Oh sweetie, I think you know why.\"\n\"Oh please, don't leave me waiting in the cold! Enlighten me! What exactly is your origin story?\" \n\"Well actually it all started with you! I fell hopelessly in love with the woman I saw all over my tv, in my tweets, and fighting on the streets. I only do bad things to get attention.\" \n\"Ohhhh really now?\" Hottie was incredulous, suspecting a new strategy to get her guard down.\n\"Really, darling.\" The sultry nature of Frosty's voice increased with every word. \n\"Well, you picked the worst way to do it!\" Hottie noted, \"you're callousness causes me a lot of distress and discomfort.\" \nHottie used this moment to throw her hands down onto the icy pavement and pulse as much fire as possible melting the floor and the threat along with it. She quickly tackled Frosty-while she was wallowing in self pity-and held her down. \n\"Now, this is what I'm talking about,\" Frosty suggestively gestured to their position. \nHottie pulled out handcuffs and played along, \"even better?\" \n\"Heck yea baby\" \nThe police walked over as Hottie handcuffed Frosty. She easily handed Frosty, kicking and screaming, over.\n\"Listen, I'm sorry darling but I don't fall for manipulative psychopaths and I certainly don't fall for people who ruin my circadian rhythm.\" ", "8 hour before the end.", "\"Villainy has made me more honest with myself.\"", "\"It's as if casting away all my emotions have made me understand them more.\"", "\"I feel weird...I shouldn't be feeling this! Why am I feeling this?\"", "\"Why does she make me feel this way? I-I should hate her...but I love her,\" thought James Clinch, AKA Master of Evil. The villain, Master of Evil, has been the reigning champion of all things nefarious in New Dawn City. To meet this threat to all that is good is the heroine, Krystal Hanway, better known as Gal Galaxy. The two has been fighting for three years now and it seems like nothing has changed until now. He noticed the reason why his plans were becoming sloppy, why she was winning easier and easier. He was letting her win and he didn't even know, however this realization came in a rather pleasant message.", "James had a dream the night before. It was a dream of him being happy. Him and her being happy together. The dream felt so far away, but so real it caused him to feeling a emotion he has long since forgot, the feeling of love. So today, he dawned his darkened hood and crimson suit with a new plan. He will end his battle once and for all.\nHe spent that 7 hour putting together an elaborate scheme just for his to the best of his abilities. The Master of Evil knew that this will be his final battle with the gallant heroine that has saved the day countless times. The thought has been running through his head all these hours and it only fueled his determination. \"Only a hour left until everything changes...a hour until the end,\" James thought to himself as he set things into motion.\nOn the clock, the villains trap was sprung. It seemed like a dream when the monument, known as the \"Tower of Dawn\" disappeared from its foundation. The monument was the symbol of the city and all its hardships. To steal the monument was like stealing the city itself. The evil master knew this quite well, and he knew the chaos such an act would stir inside the people. It will only be minutes until a certain space-themed helmet and leotard wearing hero would come on the scene to investigate.", "Gal Galaxy appeared at the scene of the crime. She was in total shock by the disappearance, but she knew only one person was capable. \"Master of Evil,\" she whispered to herself as she pressed a button on her helmet to scan for clues. However, upon pressing the button video appeared on her HUD instead. Gal Galaxy was caught off guard, but she knew she had to watch it, \"he is toying with me I just know it,\" she said in a hush whisper. The video began to play and it showed a dark hood man standing in a oddly dim room. The figure spoke,\n\"Quick to get to business aren't you Gal Galaxy?\"", "\"What are you planning? Are you planning on holding the monument for ransomed so the city to get it back?\" Said the hero, impatiently.", "The figure replied instantly, \"This is a prerecorded message, but I assume you were asking why I would steal the 'Tower of Dawn'? Well there is a good reason for it. But I won't tell you why, you will have to find me and then I'll tell you the answer.\"", "She frowned a little displeased over the circumstance. She replayed the video at least a dozen times, trying to comb through for any clues of where he might be. Gal Galaxy always knew the Master of Evil was good at playing Hide-and-Seek, but she knew he'd slip up. Then one small clue came to her attention, which caused her to grin with glee under her mask. A soft green light was glowing in the far back of the video, which allowed her to see a faint logo in the dark, a logo for an infamous car dealership that went under about two years ago. She had him now.", "James wasn't dumb; he was the Master of Evil after all. He wanted her to find him so the next part of his plan could come to fruition. It only took 5 minutes until he heard the famous warping noise that came when Gal Galaxy uses her ability to manipulate space. He watched as the one clear spot in the room began to distort and change as if the space around it has been rippled like a stone being dropped into the water. Then out stepped Gal Galaxy...the sight almost made the Master's legs to give out. The heroine quickly taken notice of the villain and yelled out in confidence, \"It's over for you Master of Evil! You are getting sloppy, maybe you should call it quits before things get serious.\"", "Her voice, a voice he has heard about a hundred times, a voice that has always held kindness and oozed self-confidence, a voice that at this moment made him pause for just a moment on each word that arose. It felt like he was listening to an old tune that he heard over and over and still never got old. But, he had no time to stay tranced as he lifted his hand and a red smoke formed from the tips. Quickly the smoke surrounded the hero and she countered by making the smoke fan out through space.", "The two have fought so many times that they know each other's moves, which is why the Master of Evil had to think outside the box. \"You know I hate not putting on a show for my guest, so how about I change things up a little?\" said the villain as he covered himself in his red smoke. Gal Galaxy used her powers to cause the smoke to disappear, but he was gone.", "\"The plan is working, but why am I doing this? I'm the the ruler of all that is heinous. The red cloud of wickedness,\" said James as he sweated in a secret room. He felt his heart was beating any he couldn't contain himself. Even the red smoke that floated from beneath his cloak was taking weird shapes, he could of sworn he seen a little red heart. He shook his head and tried to get a hold of himself. \"I still have another step in my plan that I need to do before the end.\"", "Gal Galaxy was feeling more confused than ever; she has faced this man every week since their first faithful encounter a couple years ago. It was back when she was still new and her powers have only recently appeared, and around that time a new meta said to be able to control mystical red smoke that could taint, trap, or form whatever they desired. She has always beat him, but he always got away, maybe he was taking it easy on her? The thought crossed her mind, but she dispelled it as nonsense.", "She glanced out the window at the sun that was just setting. She always liked watching the sunset, but it seem she would have to miss it for now. Then it dawned on her...the sky was unusually red. Then panic struck her as she began to realize what was going on. She quickly used her powers to appear outside of the dealership and her eyes trained on the red sky. \"H-He couldn't have!\" she said in shock, the whole sky was covered in a red cloud which she never noticed until now. His plan was beginning to unveil one giant scheme. The Master of Evil stole the monument to cover up for a bigger plot, he was going to take over the city in one swoop.\n(Continue below)", "He screamed her into his office. It was the third time this week, and he knew he ought to be more discreet, but he had to see her.", "\"What have I done wrong now?\" she almost spat the words at him, but he didn't care. She had a slender but tall frame, and she had long dark hair that fell in soft waves down her back. Her eyes were a haunting shade of green, and she had smooth ivory skin. He wanted her, but he knew she would never be his.", "\"I need you to finish the Emerson case yesterday. And I need it done by tomorrow morning.\" He growled at her and her expression turned from slightly disgruntled to visibly upset.", "\"That case would take me all night!\" She pleaded with him, saying he was being irrational. If she had been anyone else he would have fired them on the spot, but he dismissed her and got back to work. ", "He stayed late to watch her. She was working furiously in the conference room. ", "He loved the way her brows furrowed when she was deeply focused on an assignment. He loved the way she would toss her hair into a wild mop on the top of her head to keep it out of her face. Most of all he loved her. But she didn't remember him.", "Never written before but here we go", "~~~~", "A figure, dressed in a simple hood, track pants and runners, stepped over the charred remains of what appeared to be a combat robot, a trail of embers following him. ", " , he mused to himself. The person in question was Blaze, a 'superhero', whose power revolved around control, manipulation, and usage of fire. His arch rival was the super villain Iceika, an ice cold girl that built robots to do her bidding. Sure to his statement, blast doors opened, and more robots came pouring forth, spraying wildly with their weapons. Sighing, he ignited his hands, and then he body, and he surged forward as he turned into a small brightly burning trail of fire. He zipped around the robots, his trail scorching and burning any robot it came in contact with. One of the bullets from the robots found purchase as it crossed through the main trail, eliciting a cry of pain from the hero.  He turned back into human form as he hit the ground sprawling. A bullet had passed through his left thigh. Growling, his hands burst alight as he charged forth, ignoring the pain. He let loose a barrage of fireballs as he charged, robot after robot being burnt as he charged them. As the last one fell, the water sprinklers turned on, triggered by his fire, and water began to pour over him. He shrieked as it splashed into his exposed fire, the pain driving his hands numb as he rushed to cover them, instinctively sinking to the grounf. A distinctly feminine laugh filled the air. ", " As if on queue, the largest door on the room opened, and the villain stepped forth. ", "She was clad in white, with grey plates of light armour attached, light blue runes glowing. She brushed her near-white blonde hair out of her face with a black gloved hand. A white mask wrapped around her face. Her ice cold eyes stared directly at the young hero on the ground. 'Ah, Blaze, thank you for accepting my invitation!' she exclaimed gleefully as she approached him, stopping a couple metres before him. The boy's face immediately contorted in confusion. 'Invitation? You said that you were going to blow up a bomb and freeze the city and I came to stop you.'", "She stared back at him, her own face perplexed. 'That was the invitation, dummy.'", "The water sprinklers turned off, and Blaze slowly pulled his hood off his face, revealing his dark skin to the dim lighting. 'Invitation? What kind of new trick is this? Weaken me so you can encase me in frozen ice?'", "She closed the distance, and now stood at arms' length. She stood taller than he did. He was pretty short. But she was Vlose enough for her cold breath to reach him, sending chills down his spine, both figuratively and literally. 'No, dear, if I wanted you hurt I'd have done so already. No, I invited you for something el-'", "'So you're trying to tell me this is an accident?' He mumbled as he showed his thigh. Iceika's reaction was not what he expected, as she rushed to inspect his leg, kneeling in front of him", "'Oh my God I'm so sorry! Th-that wasn't m-meant to happen! But how? I set the aim of those robots to 'Worse than White Arnoured Sci-Fi Soldiers! I'm so sorry!'", "Iceika's mere presence cancelled out any of his powers, so he had no way to escape. He would simply have to wait...", "'It's ok, it'll heal...but what was I invited for?", "'I wanted someone to talk to,' she responded as he got a band aid out from her pocket. She sloppily applied it to the wound. ", "'So you built an army of robots, trashed a jewellery store, got me to come and fight said army of robots in tour secret lair, so you could..talk to me? Why me? I'm not interesting...'", "She gasped, and slammed her hands into the ground in front of her (or either side of him, idk how to put it) and leaned forward. Her eyes narrowed.  'I wanted to talk with you, and you are interesting.  Very interesting' she awkwardly pulled her arms back. ", "Seeing that arguing would not get him anywhere, he tried to converse with her. He wasn't usually good at talking with girls...much less a super villain...'so...what do you want to talk about?'", "She shifted uncomfortably, looking at a very interesting piece of flooring. 'I was wondering...if you wanted to go to dinner with me....' she wrapped her arms around himself. ", " 'Why...me...?'", "She looked up, and straight into his charcoal eyes. 'B-because...i...like you...d-dummy....'", "As he heard that, he immediately looked at the ground, trembling. 'No, you don't,' he stammered. ", "She looked back at him, clearly hurt. 'But I just sai-'", "'No, you don't,' he growled. Rage began to pour into him, enough for his hands to ignite again. ", "She weakly tried to reach out. 'I really do-'", "'No, you don't!' He cried out as he stood up, tears welling in his eyes. 'No one can! No one can like me, so stop lying!'", "She took her mask off, and tried to approach him. 'I do. I really do. Why else do you think I'm always trying to get you to come? Why else would I put so much time and effort into trying to get your attention, trying to get you to at least talk with me? All those times I captured you, I did it so I could talk to you...' tears ran down her face as she continued. 'Just because you were hurt before doesn't mean you have to push everyone away. Just because your parents abused and neglected you doesn't mean others will. Just because other people bully and harass you doesn't mean I will. Please...'", " he loosened up, as his fire died down. 'You mean...all this time...you just wanted to be...with...me...?'", "'Mhm' she sniffled. ", "Anger met him again. 'Lies.' He ignited his hands and prepared to go. He had been here too long. He turned around, gritted his teeth, and began to run. ", "Her eyes widened. 'No! Don't go!' she cried as she ran after him. In his weakened state, he was not running very fast, and he growled as she closed the distance. She dived for him, and tackled him to the ground. They went sprawling, and she latched on to his right arm, and refused to let go, even as he kneeled, preparing to leave again. 'Please..trust me...' she croaked, her teary eyes looking straight at him. Her right hand went and cupped his left cheek, her cold skin causing him to flinch.", "His heart melted as he began to cry bitter tears. 'Why...why me... what have I ever done to deserve care...deserve friendship...deserve love...?' ", "She smiled back, and wiped his tears away. 'Because everyone deserves a chance. We all deserve a shot at love.'", "He clenched his eyes shut, and he shuffled closer to her. He wiped her tears away with his own hand. His dark eyes locked onto her own blue ones, as they stood up. Without a word, they embraced, and slowly melted to the ground.", "Together, they lay on the floor, tears of joy running down their faces, hands entwined and refusing to release the other. 'So...will you come to dinner with me...?' She inquired nervously.", "'Of course,' he responded with a smile.", "Hours passed as they continued to lay on the lab floor. Eventually, he had fallen asleep, but she was still awake. ", " she slowly peeled his arm off her, and stood up. ", " she wondered as she looked at the time. 7pm. She sent a message to her robot to come with the teleporter. Glancing back at his sleeping body, she walked over, and gingerly picked him up and held him in her arms. ", "The ride home was nothing spectacular, because teleporters don't take long.  The robots took care of his wound as she took her armour off, and put on a shirt and pants. She walked into her room, and sighed happily as she saw his sleeping figure tucked in the bed. She climbed in, and placed herself In his arms as she dozed off.", "~~", "So was that good? I hope it is....", "I scanned the skyline hopefully, watching the lights.  He would come.  He'd have to.", "The theater was burning.", "I was standing on the roof of the building, surrounded by neon and smoke.  I could hear sirens approaching.  The rumpus of the panicked crowds drumming beneath my feet was only getting more intense.  This was it - there was no way he could ignore this kind of invitation.  It was the equivalent of using a skywriter to sketch a confession in the air, for pete's sake.", "The smoke was getting thicker, and I could see the heat warping the air in places.  My feet were getting hot.  I checked the street below and saw the firefighters hard at work, fighting the blaze and keeping back the bystanders.  It wouldn't be much longer - I know him.", "When I got back home that night, his things were still gone.", "\"A-ha! Looks like you can't move, Burnella!\" I said.", "\"Damn you, Lucius!\" said Burnella while having her entire body trapped in a block of clear amber from the neck down, unable to activate her mystic  fire powers. \"Once I get out of here you're gonna pay!\" ", "I simply stared at her, trying to hide my childlike happiness and glee under a typical evil grin.\nFinally, I had managed to catch Burnella! Ever since I had first fought her I was in love. Fiesty personlity, great wit, beautiful orange hair flowing out from her mask and down her back, and hips to die for. She was a gift from Heaven.", "But I had never been able to capture her long enough to be close to her long. But now I have captured her to where she has to  stay.", "I could hear her squeaks under her mask as she tried to struggle out of the amber. Adorbs.", "I had to impress her. I can't just say that I love her. She would think I'm pathetic.  I had to  just do nice stuff for her so that Stockholm syndrome might kick in at some point. ", "\"Yeah. That oughta work. I'm pretty sure I am the same age as her. I'm rich, I got robots, I'm the perfect guy. You can do this Lucius.\" I screamed mentally.", "I walk up to her. She continues to curse and yell at me while struggling. I lean on the block she's encased in to make myself look confident from the get-go.  \"You haven't moved an inch, Burnella. If you keep struggling you will be too tired to fight me later.\"", "She sighed and stopped. \"Curse you....\" she said in defeat as her head sunk.\nAlright.  Now that she's cooled down a bit I can give her my gift.", "I  got it out of that cardboard  box, and walked behind her. ", "She tensed up again.  \"What are you  doing? You stay away from me!\" she spat. I then slowly placed it on her head.", "\"What is this thing?! LUCIUS WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!!\" she said, panicked. \nI couldn't have her being afraid like this. I quickly got out the mirror so she could see.", "\"Wha...A flower crown?\" she said. I looked at my crafting project, filled with orange and white flowers, which I knew would match her beautiful hair.\n\"Why did you put a flower crown on my head?!\" she exclaimed in confusion.\nAny excuse I had was lost once I noticed that I could see her eyes through her goggles up close.", "\"uhh uhh F-for paralyzing you! With toxic things! Ha-ha!\" I choked out.", "\"I already can't move\"", "\"Well....it's for paralyzing you just in case.\"", "\"Ooookay.\"", "I stood there in front of Burnella in awkward silence. Damnit. I knew I had embarassed myself. I had to talk with her more to get her into me.", "I walked closer to her.  l looked down and tried to think of something she would like, and fast.", "\"If you're taking this opportunity to  stare at my chest I will ignite the Great Fire of London onto the most private of your parts.\" said Burnella.

As a decoration?\" ", "\"No.....it's just that......\" I resisted the urge to stroke her hair. \"I am planning on....using your power against the city..... I will make a laser out of your energy to burn the city! \"", "She didn't react. I don't think she was buying it.", "\"I will show the world who is it's master!!\" I screamed dramatically as I took out my laser gun and disintegrated a hole into the ceiling with a bright light.

Won't that reveal your secret identity?\" I said in confusion.", "\"No. You're not gonna be able to tell who I am just through looking at my face.\" she said with depression obvious in her voice.", "\"Good point.\" \nI unhooked the mask from the latch connected to the rest of Burnella's suit, and threw it away.", "\"Oh.....\" I said. \nThere, on Burnella's cheek, was a dark red burn in the shape of a hand on her face.

As the dust cleared, and the alarms began to ring, Perfecto stared up at them, shock written across his face.", "\u201cListen carefully, Perfecto,\u201d Cortena said, her voice thrumming with her collected power, calm like the waters before a tsunami, \u201cwe came to check on you, and you attacked us.

Once those doors opened and it was nearing drop time, I chucked my parachute out the door and jumped. It was terrifying, yet liberating, I had about 60s before I should hit, so I would just load before them. I spent about 30 messing around, but then I got a little freaked out at the thought of how crazy this was... fuck this... I'm done.", "I closed my eyes and... nothing. NOTHING. OH FUCK!

I was in a fight with a bigger kid, Arnie Jacobson. Meaner than a mama grizzly, and about the same size too. He copied my answers on a test, maybe math...? We both failed the test. Wasn't my fault, that was for damn sure. But the moment he cornered me outside, something triggered in my head, and the world got ever so slightly brighter. Just for a second. When he threw that first punch, it broke my nose. I did what any scared kid would do, wish that this wasn't happening. This is a dream right? I don't get in fights! ", "And there I was, back in the corner, Arnie winding up his throwing arm to break my nose again. ", "I dodged the first hit, but got hit by the followup. Suddenly, there I was, in a loop with mama grizzly, dodging the same hits over and over and over. I learned his moves, fought the guy for what felt like hours. Each time I started over, I could remember the events of the past, but physically, my body returned to full strength. I could heal my bones, restore my stamina, put everything back to the way it was. It was incredible. The only caveat, that I'd find out too late, was that if the body already wants to kill you, there's not much you can do to stop it. ", "So what seemed like a quick fight to the schoolchildren watching us was a long and arduous course on hand to hand combat. I must have looked like a little orange blur to Arnie, the poor bastard. I took him down with a few good hits that he never saw coming. ", "From that point on, I practiced scenarios of every day life. Job interviews were a cakewalk. Schoolwork always came easily. I could just redo everything, over and over again. ", "When I was a man in the 70s, I think, I involved myself in the stock market. That was a ride. Bet on the wrong horse? Go back and bet on the other. I made more money that I knew what to do with! So I settled down, bought a house, married my wife, lived the American dream. I was so good at altering my life, I didn't think about how I could affect others until September, 2001. ", "I kept going back to the day prior. I kept resetting, going back to the tenth. Tried to get a hold of anyone that could warn the people in those towers. I thought, what better way to serve my country? This is patriotism! But the more I went back, the more I saw those planes hit the towers, the more I began to realize that on a global scale, time marched on. What if I could go back and tell those boys not to hijack the planes? What if I could phone every single person who worked in those buildings not to go into work that day? ", "That's not how time works. Once you make a new 'save', you can't go back to a previous one. I had a hard few weeks after that.

", "But just like my stint as a wannabe hero, time marches on. And now, it seems to only be getting worse. Every time I go back, things are different without me changing them. Objects are in the wrong place, pieces of the walls are missing. There's a black cloud that hangs over my vision, every time. It's starting to scare me.

Some of my more intricate schemes took weeks to develop instead of just a few fleeting seconds.  Redoing those ones took its toll.", "I haven't used the ability in thirty years.  It was starting to wear on my body and mind.  Scars started to show up on fatal wounds I had undone.  Phantom aches and pains plagued me and I was having a hard time remembering what happened in the second, third, or tenth failure and what I decided to keep as progress.  Despite no family history of cancer, I'd have developed three different varieties over the span of six years, and Alzheimer's-like symptoms started to develop despite none of the tests confirming it.  I decided that the pain wasn't worth it anymore.", "Today is special.  After years of my body destroying itself I feel the need to live again.  The doctor that treated me drove his Corvette every day.  He never once opened the girl up and let her stretch her legs.  Today, my birthday, that car and I were going to live if only for a moment.  ", "I look around the room taking in all the details surrounding me.  I take a deep breath and close my eyes.  I picture the room in my mind.  There.  Saved.  I can revert here if anything goes wrong.", "During the doctor's visit, it goes easy.  Pickpocketing was a skill I learned for fun when I first discovered this ability.  He was so distracted with my charts he'd have never noticed anyway.  After he leaves the room and disappears into the next, I slip into the elevator down the hall.  A nurse sees me just as the doors close, but it's too late.  I get to the garage and the sexy curves of American muscle look like they know what's coming and they're excited.  I slip behind the wheel, and we're off.", "Getting to the interstate is slow and frustrating, but oh so worth it.  I have my reversion if I hurt myself or anyone else.  I open up the throttle and scream down the highway.  I don't remember speed being this intimidating.  Have I slipped that much?  I hit a sharp turn and feel tires lose their grip.  I'm going too fast.  The guard rail is approaching fast.  I feel very alive right now.  Adrenaline is pumping.  Glad I have that......", "Agent Jenkins had a near panic look in his eyes.  \"If we don't get to the extraction point now, the Russians will get us AND the intel!  we have to go!  Your cover is blown!\"  ", "Wait, what?  This is 30 years ago.  It took me twenty five reversions to escape the KGB. I escaped though.  I escaped and retired.  I retired to a small cabin to fish and then... Oh no.  ", "This is the story of my end. Or my beginning. It's all relative to how you look at the world.

If something didn't go my way I could just jump back and start over. Crazy you say? I thought so too and I was terrified of it until I realized I could use to get what I wanted, anything I wanted, or so I thought. ", "It all started when I was younger. I grew up in a poor household, with little to our name, but lots of love and strong morals. It's funny how circumstance can change morals, I look back at that first time I abused my power and wonder what would have happened if I had resisted. ", "I stole a loaf of bread. We hadn't enough money to buy food that day and we were all starving, my mother, my sister and myself. I never knew my dad and I never bothered to find out. All I knew was he left and that was all that mattered to me. Anyway, that loaf of bread. I wondered if I could steal it, so I tried. I was just so hungry. Guess what? I got caught. Boom! All of a sudden I was making the decision again, do I steal it? I tried again, differently this time. I got that loaf of bread. I never told my sister or my mother where it came from but I suspect they guessed. ", "From there I started small, stealing when was necessary but as I continued I became addicted to the thrill of being caught. They couldn't hold me, I could start over, do it again, do it better. My rumor grew, I stole gold, diamonds, riches beyond anyone's need. Passcodes and locks were meaningless. I could just keep cracking anything and when I got caught just start over and pick up where I left off. Rumors grew, things disappeared. It all was fantastic until I met her. ", "It was just another job, another heist, and as I was doing my recon she passed by the corner of my eye. I didn't think much of it at the time. I did the heist, another perfect job, and yet I had this nagging feeling I had missed something. I realized I was thinking about her. I had to find her. Try and steal something I had never stolen before. It was to be my greatest success. ", "I planned everything, every contingency. I was to run into her at the coffee shop she frequented. As I approached I was nervous but I was confident. I could just try over if something went wrong. I got closer, I was almost there. She saw me, she smiled, I smiled, I started to open my mouth. I wanted to say \"hi.\" Just one little word. I choked. I didn't know what to do. I froze. Everything started falling apart. I had never felt this before. She laughed. Not at me, just one of those adorable laughs. I tried to start over, go back again. I was going to get this right. And then I couldn't. I lost it. I was more terrified than I'd ever been. I had to recover. I tried again without going back. I choked out the word \"hi.\" That's how it ended. That's how it started. ", "This is the story of the greatest thief in the world, with the power to jump back in time to start over. My greatest achievement was not the riches however, it was her heart. ", "You see, what kept me from starting over, what made me loose my power, was love. It tied me to that timeline. That is how the Thief became the Husband. I gave it up, all of it, for her.

About \"stakes\", I mean. \"High stakes\". The idea that there were things that were ", " a bad idea. Maybe, for some of them, the pay-out is worth it, and maybe they work out. The problem is, they might not. That risk calculus is apparently something people deal with their entire lives. And, you know, I did think sometimes that things would be more exciting that way. Every once in a while, at least - not often; mostly when I had to relive these tiny variations over and over again until I got it right. Even more so when I went through all of that and then backed-out regardless. Sometimes things just don't seem to work out perfectly, and it doesn't matter whether it's the first time or the hundred thousandth. That hundred-thousand and first time, when you finally change your mind, is a bit of a kick to the face. But then you dust yourself off and realize maybe today just isn't your day to rob a bank.

Honestly, ninety-nine percent of the time, it was. It takes practice, safely landing a plane the \"first time\" you sit down behind the controls. Practice and a lot of fractured femurs and shattered spines. Scorched and scarred skin. A lot of punctured pulmonaries and lacerated lungs. But then, just the slightest pull, a tug behind my rib-cage coming from a place I never really understood, a pitch-black second or day or century in a place where I can't feel my hands, and then I'm right back behind the wheel. I'm telling a terrified co-pilot that - this? No, I've totally got this, really, this all would go so much smoother if you toned it down for a second - this is really nothing to worry about. And then - eventually - we're on the ground, or I'm strolling out of the bank, or whatever. It all starts to run together eventually.", "Autopilot. Door. Shift. Left, rebar. Right, pistol. Swing right. Three rounds.", "I used to wonder. How everything was always the exact same. Not a single strand of hair out of place, not on a single head in the room, or the plane, or, well, wherever. Nothing where it shouldn't have been; the only difference afterwards was what was in my head. So I know where the guard is, where the tellers are, who is going to be trouble and which side of the vestibules the silent alarm trigger is on. I know the tellers' tells; I've seen weight shifted and bad legs favored and one that giggles when she's nervous and one that'll only be a problem once he's stone-faced.

Why do it at all? Doesn't matter, I guess. It had felt a little different this time, the pull. Just imagining things, probably. By now I was on autopilot, going through the motions without even thinking. If ten thousand hours was the difference between good and great I'd left world-class behind decades ago. ", "Autopilot. Open the door. Shift to the right to avoid the disheveled three-piece headed outside. Left hand to a small section of rebar and right hand to a pistol that I could flawlessly pencil from memory down to the valence shells. Throw the rebar through the door handles.

I was still standing, the gun still leveled at where the guard was supposed to be. Where he had been a thousand thousand times before.", "Another.", "Another.", "I used to wonder. What everybody else went through when this sort of thing happened. What it could possibly be like to have something go ", ", when there's no way to undo it or turn back or try again. I feel the pull again, but it's off somehow - like too much coffee forced through a French press. I may have mumbled something about grounds once I hit the cool tile of the bank floor, but I couldn't hear it if I did. I couldn't hear that or the guard - blurrier than he had any right to be - making his tentative steps toward me from my left, gun still drawn, left hand holding a baton. The pull is stronger now, the coffee filter between me and taking another shot at Schrodinger's rent-a-cop overwhelmed by what feels an awful lot like takeoff.", "Autopilot. It's not more exciting.

His powers had gone. ", "\"Fuck\" he yelled as loud as he could. A tear ran down his cheek as he knew there was nothing he could do to get those 200 hours back and then it hit him there was something he could do, with determination in his heart he loaded his new file and started playing again knowing it wouldn't take as long since he knew everything he needed to do, but first he needed to get a drink. He walked into the kitchen grabbed a bottle of beer and saw a puddle of blood on the floor, \"heh serves her right\" he thought, then less than a split second later a jolt went down his spine, she was dead, he tried to go back to his quicksave but remembered that his powers had disappeared. \"Fuck, fuck, shit, ass, I only killed her because I thought I could go back\". He went to get a towel to clean up the mess when a massive light shone through his kitchen window. \"we know you're in there, come out with your hands up\" the rolling rock dropped to the floor and smashed \"Fuck\" he said.

Right before I was about to chalk it up as a coincidence, the policeman got out of his car, and starting briskly walking towards me.", "\"Sir, can I ask you a question?\" he said in a low, gruff voice.", "He was in his mid-40's but he had the body of an NFL linebacker, and I started to get nervous. \"Good afternoon officer, can I help you with anything?\" I realized afterwards that my attempt to sound sincere had transformed into a mid-puberty sounding screech. ", "He stopped about 2 feet away from me, and the look in his eyes told me that there was a problem. \"Are you Mark John Swanson by any chance?,\" he said. I felt my Adam\u2019s apple take a deep dive down my throat, and far off I felt a sensation of warm water trickling down my legs. ", "\"Um.. yeah.. about that,\" and with no hesitation I sprinted as fast as I could towards the church. ", "I burst through the church doors, and at once everyone's eyes turned towards me. I started a mad rush down the aisle, faintly aware of the widening puddle of piss accumulating on the crotch of my pants.", "\"Sarah Ann McThomas, I love you with all my heart,\" I said between gasps of ragged breath. The aisle seemed much longer than it had the first time around, and after what felt like an eternity, I was at the altar again. Realizing how ridiculous I must look right now, smelling like a urinal and covered in sweat, I addressed my sweet Sarah.", "\"Sarah, I won't let you marry this guy. After all we've been through, after all the secrets we've shared with each other, I know that you're the one for me. If you can just look deep in your heart, I think you...\" CRACK! ", "I felt my spine shudder as what felt like a freight train collided into my back. I flew five feet forward and smashed my head on the first step of the altar. I felt a strong stream of blood trickling down my face, and one of my eyes wasn't cooperating when I told it to open. ", "\"Mark Swanson, you are under arrest,\" I heard in the gravelly voice of Mr. Ray Lewis-turned police officer. As I felt my arms yanked behind my back, I gathered all my strength to look up again at Sarah. The shock she had expressed the first time around had been replaced by heavy tears and a look of pure hatred on her face.", "\"I knew you were going to come here, Mark,\" she growled at me. \"I saw your buddy Josh at the grocery store yesterday, and he told me you were going to be here. I told the police to keep an eye on you today. I can't have you ruining my life anymore.\" ", "As I contemplated everything she had just said to me, something didn't add up. My buddy Josh was in Maui this week. I drove him to the airport and watched his plane take off. A sense of dread started to grow within me like a dark dye spreading in water. I felt another few trickles of piss make their way down my legs. ", "\"Could it be?\" I thought. \"Could my checkpoint have been compromised?\"", "\"It's okay,\" I thought to myself. \"I'll just transverse again and everything will be fine.\" As I tried to mentally locate my checkpoint, I found I couldn't do it. I gathered all my brain-power and focused intensely on my checkpoint at the entrance of the church, but I wasn't going anywhere. My heart stopped for a couple of beats. ", "After a few tries, I knew that I wouldn't be transversing anymore. Not today. Not ever. ", "My train of thought was interrupted by the policeman yanking me to my feet, and leading me very painfully back down the aisle.", "As I was forced out of the church, I looked around at the wedding guests. There was a different expression on every face. Some people were crying, some were laughing so hard it looked like they were crying, and some people were yelling at me to \"just get the fuck out of here.\" I started to think about the consequences I was facing. Not about the jail cell and the cold soup I'd be served, but the fact that I would probably never speak to Sarah Ann McThomas ever again. ", "This thought troubled me so much that I let out a scream. In that scream, I released 4 years-worth of anticipation of winning Sarah back.", "We slowly made our way down the church steps to the police car. With all the grace of a WWE wrestler, the policeman shoved me headfirst into the backseat. The cop opened his door and sat at the wheel for a moment. After a few seconds he spoke to me. ", "\"I had one like her when I was your age,\" he said. \"She ended up marrying a lawyer and for the better part of 3 years I was pretty depressed. But then one day, I looked in the mirror, and thought back to something my father used to say. 'Not all that glitters is gold, son.'\"", "Despite my overwhelming misery, I couldn't help but smile at the policeman's little proverb. As the officer put his key in the ignition, I thought to myself, \"I think Mary Beth is getting married in a few months, let's see if I can get out of jail by then.\"", "A ray of warm sunlight shone through the car as the policeman pulled into the street, and I started to think about the perfect way to crash a wedding.", "I let out a small breath, watching my breath stain the miniature mirror stuffed in my locker. My face looked calm, tranquil even, but my shaky hands covered in beads of sweat told me otherwise. I glanced quickly at Gwen, hoping that we wouldn't make eye contact.  She looked as beautiful as ever, her golden hair resting perfectly on her shoulders, not a hair out of place. Her cheerleading outfit hugged her body, which made the drab maroon and gray almost ruby and silver. Must be a football game tonight. She stood alone at her locker, something not usual. If there was ever a chance it was now.", "I knew how silly this was. A few weeks ago, I discovered my ability to \"quick save\" any moment in my life. I remember sitting on my wooden, creaky deck trying to comprehend the possibilities of this power. I had always been limited by my shyness. But here I had the ability to assert myself and take risks, without any repercussions. I had started out small. Throwing up an impossible shot against my small, plastic basketball hoop while playing my cousin was my first choice. The ball didn't even get close to the rim, but no one would ever know. All i had to do was refresh my life back to the last time I \"saved\". ", "Yet, my stomach turned now. Somehow my ability to \"quick save\" hadn't helped calm my stomach. Any minute now, Gwen would close her locker and my moment would be gone. It had to be now. I took a few deep breaths which turned out to be a few quick, sharp breaths. I closed my eyes and a voice in my head stated, \"File saved.\" One more breath and I pushed my myself toward her. I got closer and closer and yet my anxiety become worse and worse. What would I say so that she will smile? Should I lean against her locker like the cool kids did in all those old movies or should I stand up straight and confident? What should I do with my hands? ", "\"What do you want?\" Her voice snapped me out of my thoughts. I was standing in front of her now, and my stomach dropped once more. \"Um...uh....do you want to go to Prom with me?\", I asked trying to add a confident smile to the end of my sentence but it must have looked like a smirk. \"Ew no, I would never go with you. I'm already going with Chad anyway.\" My heart sunk but now my anxiety flared up again. My mouth was moving at a million miles an hour trying to find a way to reverse this all. \"Uh..yeah..no I was just asking just in case you didn't have anyone to go with.\" It was time for me to return back to my previous save. Maybe if I practice this over and over, I will get the suave interaction I was hoping for. ", "I closed my eyes and recalled my last save. This would be all over soon. \"Error! File corrupted\" said the voice in my head. I froze. There was no way back. I was stuck in this moment. A cold fear crashed over me. I felt cornered, as if everyone in the halls was looking at me and judging my interaction. \"What the fuck are you doing here?\" asked Chad behind me. I turned, almost jumping out of my skin. This was not going to end well.", "I was 13 when I first discovered I had the power to go back to a moment in time and relive life from that point again. I guess you could call it a quick save. At that age I was young and stupid, and didn't realise the gravity of what I had discovered. I toyed with it for a while on the small things, like telling a teacher off in class, punching that annoying kid up the back who wouldn't shut up, kissing the popular girl, that sort of thing.", "But at that age, being in high school the inevitable happened - bullying. Being a weedy kid I was a prime target. This one brute of a kid decided he didn't like me and thought it'd be fun to knock me around a bit. It only took two incidents for me to realise that this would make a prime use of my newly discovered skillset. Each morning I would take the quick save waiting for the next time he'd raise a hand to me, and that day came. This time he was particularly violent, broke my nose, the bastard. Time to put it to the test. I reloaded from that morning's save and went to school as normal, but this time I came prepared with a baseball bat. His approached was identical to the first time I saw it, I figured his attack would be the same also. I managed to dodge it and in doing so he began to lose his balance and fall past me, I grabbed the bat and hit him on the back on his way through sending him to the ground. Not long after that I found myself in the principal\u2019s office knee deep in shit. I decided that this was now how I wanted it to go down so I reloaded from that morning and instead dodged the attack and left him to fall on the ground humiliating himself.", "I discovered in the following days that there were side effects of reloading. I found out that this bully had\u00a0 memories of being hit by me with a baseball bat, his friends putting it down to the Mandela Effect as they'd never seen or heard of this happening - after all it would have been big news around the school. I didn't encounter him again unless we shared a class, or went past each other house on the way to or from school. It was a win I figured, the biggest brute in school stops bullying me for no reason, I figured I was safe for the rest of school, and so I was.", "Years later, at my next milestone birthday - 21, I got a strange sensation. it was like I was able to see things more clearly. Memories became clearer and more vivid, like they only just happened, but stranger than that was what felt like I had more memory. I didn't think much of it until later that day when I took a save before my party - I mean come on, it's a 21st, who knows would trouble I was likely to get into. When saving I noticed in the top right of my vision the number 2. It struck me as curious and I pondered it for a while but couldn't think of a reason why it had happened. That night went fine and I had no need to reload.", "A few weeks later I went for an interview for a job I desperately wanted. I took a save before leaving home and I saw the \"2\" again. I went to the interview and completely bombed. not content with failing it I went to reload and instead of the instantaneous load I used to have I found myself choosing between the last save I took before I turned 21, and the one from that morning. I reloaded from that morning and aced the interview and not long after I found myself in the career I'd always wanted.", "Life was sweet. I'd used my 20's to travel, see the world, learn languages, make friends, all the things 20 yo me wanted to do. Then came the day I turned 30. For the equivalent of the past 20 years I'd been living my 20's and seeing that \"2\", and I wondered, will it become a 3? I woke the morning of my 30th, and for if nothing but curiousity did a save, and there it was, a \"3\" in the top right. I started feeling nostalgic for my youth and reloaded my last save before my 21st and relived the day in its entirety. And I wondered, what would happen if I saved again tomorrow, on my 21st. And i did it, and I saw that familiar \"2\". I had lived my 20's beyond their fullest and now had the opportunity to do it again if i ever wanted to. But I now had my 30s to explore. I loaded the morning of my 30th and for the first time I saw a new message in my field of vision - \"3 Loaded\". Good thing I thought, with these extra saves it could become confusing.", "I lived my 30s, 40s, and 50s, and it felt like I'd lived multiple lifetimes, maximising every second of it. But I began to feel nostalgic again and wanted to revisit my childhood, before the saves. I took a save before leaving home and the now familiar \"5\" appeared. I drove to my childhood neighbourhood to discover that it had become an unsavoury place - barred windows, unkempt gardens and rusting cars in driveways, it was a sad sight but determined to revisit it all I kept on to my childhood home.", "As I got out of my car a man approached me, he seemed familiar but i couldn't place him. As we approached each other there wasn't even an acknowledgement of each other\u2019s existence and we passed by. I stopped a few paces down the road and turned to see him facing me with a gun drawn, aimed squarely at my face. In that moment I recognised him - it was the bully from school. I'd never been in a situation like this and instead of reloading I froze. His cold, near lifeless eyes pierced me as he muttered \"This is for the baseball bat that never happened\".", "My vision started to pixelate and go black, jittering between his face and the gun he held, and pure blackness. I tried to reload but it wasn't working. That moment seemed to take forever, but as my vision went to pure black I heard the crack of the bullet firing. And then nothing. Was i dead? I couldn't be, I could feel warmth around me. It was comforting, and yet a strange sensation. But it began to become claustrophobic, VERY claustrophobic. My vision was pierced by a blinding light and a sudden release from the claustrophobia. I felt a grip around my neck and my legs and what felt like being thrown into the air. And then I heard this booming voice coming from behind me but I couldn't see anything through that light, it said \"Congratulations, it's a boy\". And then I saw it, in the top right of my vision \"Autosave 0 loaded\".", "\u201cAre you ready now?\u201d ", "That\u2019s what he says. Every single time I come back to this point. No matter what I change, no matter where I go in between, his words are the one things that stays the same every time. ", "I\u2019ve done everything I can. Tried every option I could think of. I traveled the world looking for answers. Bumbled my way through frustratingly slow conversations translated to foreign doctors. Spent stolen fortunes on black market pharmaceuticals. Altered the nation\u2019s top oncologists medical records. Lost my own medical license numerous times along the way. Nothing worked. I\u2019ve turned back the clock at the death bed more times than I can remember. ", "Six months ago, after I heard the news for the first time, I was determined to do anything possible to avoid the inevitable. For six months, I never felt more useless. The first time he asked me \u201cAre you ready now?\u201d, I couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t think, so I ran. Ran out of the room, out of the hospital, I just ran. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what I could have done differently to prevent this. I held my head between my hands, pressing in as hard as I could, trying to convince myself that the world isn\u2019t on a set path, that the countless decisions we make could lead to a different outcome. \u201cI could change it!\u201d I whispered harshly to myself. \u201cI still can! I just need more time! Just need more time\u2026just need more time\u2026just need more time\u2026.\u201d How long I repeated that to myself, I don\u2019t know, but when I finally stopped, I found myself six months in the past, at the moment of the diagnosis. ", "Now, I have relived these six months in a thousand different ways, trying everything I can to change the future. If I focus hard, I can return myself to that moment six months ago and, if I make an effort, I can even create a new moment to return myself to, but only within the span of this past six months, I can go back no further. In some instances, when I managed to get a hold of some new medicine or when I found some experimental technique, things would get better, and I would create a new return moment and attempt to build on that progress but every time, somehow, it ended the same way. \u201cAre you ready now?\u201d, he says. ", "I turn away and turn back the clock. \nMy mind must be hundreds of years old and I feel it. Stretched unnaturally and wearing thin after so many attempts to change my circumstances. I couldn\u2019t keep it up anymore. Since going back has failed to change anything, I decided to go forward, just a bit. Just to see what else he would say. After all this time, the past has become my only comfort and my instincts scream out that going forward is a terrible mistake but I have to try.", "As I enter the room I can\u2019t help but look into his eyes. If feels surreal, like looking into a living mirror. He looks as old and haggard as my mind feels and as I walk up to his bedside and place my hand on his, he gives me one of his old tired smiles and says it.\n\u201cAre you ready now?\u201d, he says, his voice a rough whisper.", "\u201cI\u2026I tried\u2026I tried everything\u2026\u201d,I stammer out.", "\u201cI know. I\u2019ve been ready for a while now.\u201d He says gripping my hand tighter, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you aren\u2019t ready yet, I understand.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the words threaten to choke me, \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d though I can see his eyes shine with growing tears, \u201cYou\u2019ve been so determined. I know it sounds silly now, but I felt selfish for wanting you to be here, even when I knew you were just trying to help me.\u201d His breathing becomes more and more labored as he goes on. \u201cI wanted to stay. To hold on. Until you were done. Until you were ready.\u201d The words wrench through me. I want so badly to return myself to six months ago. To hide in the past forever, anything to avoid this pain.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve been here. I can go back. I can fix this.\u201d I get up to leave, to turn back the clock once more but he grabs my hand again before I rise.", "\u201cSon, wait\u2026just stay\u2026\u201d he says, his eyes pooled in tears, a reflection of my own, \u201cThere is nothing for you to fix. You\u2019re here. I\u2019m ready to go. Are you ready now?\u201d ", "I can\u2019t answer. I couldn\u2019t speak if I wanted to. So, instead I take his hand in both of mine and press it to my lips and then rest my forehead down on his chest. ", "When I wake, he\u2019s gone. To my own amazement I feel my chest lighten. My grief remains but as I look down at my father I can feel the whisper of relief in my heart. He looks so peaceful, like the months of disease and pain have been washed away from him. In a moment of sudden inspiration I decide to go back one more time. To use this last six months he has to spend time with him. To talk with him, to laugh with him, instead of frantically searching the globe for a miracle cure. Then a strange thing happens. As I search my mind for the memory of that moment six months ago, when this nightmare began, or for one of those many moments of false hope I saved up, I find each one has been inexorably replaced by the peaceful image in front of me.", "\"Fine.\" Once more, I must press that pressure point and restore this mess that my own imagination caused.

Fear spread throughout my body, the voice wasn't deep and bellowing, it sounded like an elderly white mans voice, with long drawn syllables at the end of certain words. I got out of bed slowly, reaching for what ever weapon I could find in my room. Luckily for me I used to play baseball so I grabbed the nearest bat I could find. \"Come out from under that bed and we can talk about the terms of my employment.\" Without a word from the unidentified voice the dram of the bed shook violently and seemed to raise off the ground. The figure of a man rose from underneath the bed. I couldn't see his features well in the dark room, but he spoke again, \"As I said before you're hired. I need a select group of people to assist me in a very tiresome task that will better the world.\" I stared at the dark silhouette in shock, but I knew I needed to stall for time until I could think of a plan.

Secondly, you didn't have to apply for this job, I sought you out because I need the best of the best.\" I stared in disbelief, what was happening? My mind raced uncontrollably as I tried to think of what to do. \"Well, if I truly am the best of the best then we should fill out a contract, but first tell me what the job is?\" The voice spoke silently and slowly, \"The job is simple, in the United States, immigration has become a growing concern. Americans are losing jobs and money to these people coming in. Our job is to build something to stop it, something to stop them all. Our job is to make... The Wall.\" I dashed quickly over to the door of my room and flipped the light switch. Before me he stood, his hair was blond and combed over to the right. His skin had a light orangish glow to it. He was radiant such as a god would be, absolutely brilliant. He looked deep into my eyes and placed a firm hand on my shoulder, \"Hello Jeremy, are you ready?\" President Trump said meaningfully. I was still in shock at the glory of the man before me, \"Ready for what, sir?\" He met my eyes, I winced at the power I could see within them, \"Ready to make America great again?\" ", "I yanked my hand back and pulled it to the relative safety of my other hand.  \"Who's there and how the fuck did you get in my apartment?!\" I kept my eyes locked at the edge of the bed and began clawing for a heavy object.", "\"Please, pardon my intrusion, dear.\" The voice was opulent, yet haunting.

The forearm abruptly ceased to an inch of exposed ulna and radius, smooth around the previously broken edges.

Why?\u201d", "\u201cI did that to my own doctor.\u201d", "My life was an accident. A bad accident. So bad that my existence had to be kept a secret. \nMy parents you two people that should not have been together. They were two of seven astronauts that were sent to Mars. The first astronauts to ever venture beyond the moon. They were seen as heroes for their \"bravery\" and \"service to their country\", but I only think that most of them were just doing it for the fame. My mother and my father did met prior to their last day on Earth, but they had a rough relationship. They were the people that got along least well in the whole group. But when they were stationed on Mars, they fell in love. Seven weeks before they were set to leave Mars, their suits detected another anomaly in my mother's suit. It was me. They started panicking. They couldn't have me, they were supposed to be doing groundbreaking scientific work! So they only told the other crew members and they all agreed to keep it quiet. \nThe trip back to Earth was a long one. My mother birthed me and I spent my infant hood and one toddler year on that space station. My mother told me that it is why I have my power, is because I was on the space station so long, but I don't believe them. My mother and father were both \"Nat\u00edvs\" a word derived from the word \"native\". It describes when the person is born and they happen to exhibit the \"powers\" of their birth environment. My dad was born in the African rainforests on a European exploration to try and find a cure for some disease. My mother was born on the coast of Japan, so she has the power of the ocean. She would never demonstrate her power to me, it was almost like she was ashamed. My father had the power to control plants and the uncanny power over animals. Anyways, I am getting off track. My mother did not care if I was out and about on the space craft. It was truly like a home to me, but then everything turned sour when we were touching down on earth. In the last hours of being in space, my mom was frantically going over the plan with the other crew members, telling them to form a circle around her to not let me show while I was being carried in her large space suit helmet. Everyone agreed and did just that as they were walking. They managed to get out of there safe and my mother immediately took me back to her home in Ireland. My family was from very different backgrounds and ethnicities, but apparently it was weird to people to see a half Asian girl who talked in an Irish accent. My mother and father named me Nova. They always said that it fit because I was born as they were parallel to a super nova while headed back to Earth when I was born. When on Earth, they passed me for a normal child, and for some reason, people never asked questions. As I was growing up, my father would tell me the stories of when a new power of Nat\u00edv was discovered. They horrified me to the core, so much so when I started displaying signs of a power, I didn't even tell my parents. One day, my mother walked in on me making a miniature star. She told me that she was far from mad at me, she was proud even. But she told me that I couldn't speak of this to anyone outside of our family. One night I heard her fighting with my dad because of it. She was telling him that we can never tell anyone, and he was telling her that people aren't like that anymore and that we should not just hide me away for the rest of my life. Eventually, my mom won. \nOver the years I learned to act normal and fine tune my powers. Other children of my kind were sent to different schools than the other children, the \"Norms\". And the adult Nat\u00edvs were usually sent to do better work than the Norms. The Nat\u00edv children were taught in their classes about how to control their powers, but I didn't have an actual teacher. My mom and dad taught me everything they knew, but that wasn't enough. I started teaching myself. I didn't mean to, but I got destructive. It got to the point to where using my powers got banned in the house. My mother was furious when she walked into my room to see me spinning a miniature galaxy over my head. I couldn't sleep one night because the clouds were covering the stars, so I mad my own. I created a small black hole, the size of the hole in a straw, then I spun it like a top. Stars spiraled out into a galaxy formation. That made me feel better, but my mother walked in as I was falling asleep. My mom and dad got in another huge fight that night. This was my life. A big ball of secrets and nasty fights. \nIt continued this way for the rest of my teenage years and continued into my adult hood. One day, I was walking down the street, almost to my home, when things got rapidly darker. The colours in the sky made it look as though it was dusk, but it was 11:54 in the morning. I looked up to the sun, only to see that the sun had become a darker orange colour. I knew what was happening to the sun, I could feel it. A sickening feeling in my chest. It felt like something was caught, but I knew there wasn't. I sprinted home. I could feel that I could do something about it. That the universe wanted me to do something about it. \nI had to fix the sun.

Well if I'm just like everyone else, how am I special? Sometimes she never made any sense. The only thing I understood was that I was different. I always asked where I was born, but never got an answer. I always dreamed it was somewhere cool, like on a mountain, or a even a hill, but I knew it wasn't anything like that. \"It just takes longer to bloom, that means it's even more special than we thought!\" That was the worst lie. It's as if I was the only one who gave up hope, and honestly, it would have felt better if others would have just shared my shame instead of try and making me forget it.

So optimistic, but how can you be optimistic for something that won't happen? My powers never bloomed during the time frame that experts say they should. And come to think of it, my Mother was right. I was special. I was unlike everyone else because I didn't have powers. Everywhere I went I was reminded how \"special\" I was. Billboards and advertising always revolved around people's powers. \"Blue is the new you!\" With an Ocean born wearing guady blue make-up. Or \"Hiring: Forest only!\". Jobs were always so particular on what landscape you were from, except for menial labor, they didn't care to ask because, well, it didn't matter. If I ever wanted a job I knew I'd be stuck working with convicts or drug addicts; the refuse of this town. My life was horrible until the second day of 8th grade. That day something strange happened.", "I was on the bus going home from school. As I sat by the window watching the scenery pass by, I noticed a few plains-born gliding through the wind, enjoying their powers. That didn't help my mood. I think I fell asleep after that, because the next thing I remembered was waking up to the bus driver shaking my shoulder. We were at my stop, and the bus was empty. The bus driver must have skipped my stop and dropped me off last, probably almost forgot about me. I got off the bus and, well, you know that feeling you get when you eat a lot of beans at lunch? Yeah, it was fajita day at school, and the people who sat by me never ate their beans, so I got all of their beans. First mistake. I kind of scurry into the house, and I'm instantly blasted with an \"Oh my God honey, where were you? Where have you been?\", ugh, the overbearing atmosphere alone could have squashed me like a bug. I ran past her, dodging an incoming hug, \"The bus had a flat!\" I lied, as I v-lined for the bathroom. As I opened the door I heard a \"Wait, honey!-\" before slamming the door. I flicked on the light switch, nothing, still dark. \"The lightbulb's out\" I heard my Mother say through the door as I fumbled to drop my pants and find the toilet. After a few 'miscalculations', I landed safely, and without hesitation let out a huge rip. I blinked. Then I blinked again. The lights were back on? No.. the shadows are all wrong. It seems like the light was.. \"It's coming through the toilet?\" I thought to myself. \"No, that's absurd\" I tried to tell myself, but I looked down and.. well. Yeah. There was light coming from within the toilet bowl. I jumped up immediately, and turned around, shadows. There was no light in the toilet, it was behind me. I turned again, nothing, still behind me. I looked behind me once more, but this time only turning my neck. Yes, it was still there, it was on my back? No, it was down a bit more. It, it seemed like it was coming from my butt? Yes, wait.. \"Why is there light shining from my ass?!\" I screamed in my head. That's when I heard my Mother through the door, \"Do you have a flashlight in there, sweety?\". I was in shock, confused, and the only thing running through my mind at that moment was \"How do I turn this off?\" I tried everything, and I mean everything: I'm not proud to admit it, but it's the truth. After a few minutes it wore off (I think), and I was able to walk out of the bathroom to a confused Mother. I guess you could say that up until that point my life was horrible, but now? Now that I found my power, it's safe to call it miserable.", "Once word got out, well, you can imagine the names. \"Lightning-bug\", \"Butt-light\", \"Shiny-Cheeks\", but the one that stuck with me throughout my middle school and high school years was \"Full Moon\". Yeah, eventually I could control which part of my body I could light up, but for the longest time it was always my butt that lit up, and at the strangest times, too. Like everyone else my powers grew as I did. I started to learn how to make other things light up, and I also learned how to take away light from other spots, kind of creating darkness. I wish that's how my power bloomed, me accidentally making a ball of darkness. Then my nickname would be something cool, like Shadow or Shade, or maybe even Darkstar. That would have been cool, \"Darkstar\". But here I am now, \"Full Moon\", your local electrician coming to save the day! In other words, I change lightbulbs now; a job for a Space-born.

They should have expected the sudden inferno at the moment of birth.", "What you won't find in the history books is that I was not the first person to be born in space and survive. I was just the first to make it back. My parents already ruled with an iron-fist but they wanted more for me. They wanted to give me the world. So under the highest level of secrecy, they started sending pregnant women to every corner of the galaxy, hoping that something would work. Hundreds of women died out there.

It was only the families who waited too long to kneel, or attempted to fight first that were destroyed. ", "Now the planet is under my rule. My parents died years ago, the result of assassins. There is an endless chain of them coming after me as well, killing them is simple though. There isn't even a mess. It's always interesting to see who will attempt to recreate my powers as well. Each ship they send out in secret disappears into the abyss before it even leaves the atmosphere. You would think they would stop trying. I suppose they will never be happy with my rule. I have never needed their approval though. ", "Everyone has a kinesis, a power determined by their place of birth. For example, most people have Earth-based powers, but people born in the mountains have more control over the air and weather. Desert people can summon sandstorms. Coastal and island people have hydrokinesis. Other common powers include ice and fire. \nThanks to the power of everyday people, Earth is agriculturally stable and energy is not a problem. In school, they teach us to hone our powers. It's supposed to be a nice place where people get along. Unfortunately, due to human nature, this is not the case.\nSome of us don't have the normal powers that others have. Take my buddy Max for example. He was born at a rock concert, so his power is the ability to cause shockwaves. Since our powers don't conform to normal expectations, we are known as Exceptions. \nI am the ultimate Exception. I am the only person to be born in space. This gives me lots of variety in my powers. For example, I can turn my body into stardust and phase through things, and I can summon any cosmic object and control it to an extent. Despite my power, I am ostracized from many social circles. I actually prefer it that way, because I know people would just use me anyway.\nMy powers cause lots of friction at school. The most annoying cases of this are found in Roy Al Payne, a mountain boy, and Stu Pidity, a volcano kid. They tease the Exceptions nonstop, and I have to deal with them every day, despite the fact that I could easily obliterate them. \nOne day, Roy and Stu challenged me to a fight. We met after school on the field. Surprisingly enough, the whole school was watching. They both attacked at once, and I might have enjoyed messing with gravity to make them hit themselves and using wormholes to teleport circles around them.\nUnfortunately, I had homework, so I just wiped them out with a meteor and flew home on a comet."], "SUBREDDIT": "WritingPrompts", "SCORE": 8798, "TOTAL": 375, "TYPE": 1}

I was in each one, standing next to the canvas looking frail and spent. I could see myself in the most recent one, wearing the clothes I still had on. Each canvas was nothing but black paint. Just a thick layer of black paint. How could that be?", "But then, seeing them all together, I noticed the cadaverous eye was growing bigger in the woman's form. And it was seeing me.  It was staring at me, here in this garage. I could feel its remorseless focus and my hearth clenched and I knew I had to burn it all down.  I turned towards the cannister of gasoline, but I walked past it into the house. I walked back into my studio.  The can of black paint bubbled with a congealed thrashing liquid. ", "I had to prepare. Pulling out another canvas, I set it up carefully and set the paint beside me. It was coming.  I had to show the world.", "It had been happening for years, at least since she was in her mid-twenties. The first time had been soon after finishing university. Anjuli had been sitting working at her desk, and then all of a sudden, she had felt as though there was a sudden pressure at the sides of her neck. Her vision had started to cloud, her mind simultaneously panicked and hazy as she felt herself slip out of consciousness, and then... she had woken up. Shaking off the unease in the pit of her stomach, she had put the episode down to a simple fainting fit.", "Once it had happened three or four more times over the next week, Anjuli had decided she ought to get it checked out. Her doctor was perplexed, but offered up a long list of possible problems - vasovagal syncope, situational syncope, anaemia, cardiac arrhythmias, even a carotid body tumour... And eventually, after several normal blood tests and even a test that seemed to originate from the middle ages, in which Anjuli was tied to a table and tipped upwards, she was finally, gently, given a diagnosis of psychogenic pseudosyncope. ", "\"What in the hell is psycho- psychogen... that?\"", "\"It's not uncommon in people your age. Sometimes, your brain can play tricks on you, and make you feel as though you're fainting with no physical cause.\"", "\"I'm not fucking lying!\"", "\"I don't think you're lying.\" If that doctor's voice got any more calming, Anjuli thought she hit her. \"It's totally involuntary, but it's caused by your mind, not your body.\"", "But protest as Anjuli might, she was sent to sit with gritted teeth through what felt like countless sessions of psychotherapy, counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. ", "Of course, a few months later, she was given plenty of reason to stop going. This time, when she woke up groggy and already irritable from one of her fainting episodes, Anjuli found a sheet of her thick drawing paper in front of her. Her eyes widened in astonishment as she looked down at it; a beautiful landscape had been sketched across the page - a sweeping river cutting its way across a lush, green forest. Anjuli let out a sharp breath. The details were simply staggering, right down to the curve of the wings of one of the birds flying over the treetops, and a glint in the river of a fish swimming beneath its surface.", "Over the week or so that followed, Anjuli woke up to more and more drawings, each more beautiful than the last. God knows she couldn't draw much more than a stick figure when she was awake - and even those were normally a bit lopsided - but she couldn't escape the conclusion that she had done this. Perhaps she just needed the rest of her brain to switch off to let her artistic side flourish and grow - perhaps she was in such a focused state that she simply couldn't spare the energy to form memories.", "And as she kept looking, Anjuli found yet more proof that she'd been awake, roving the house in search of inspiration. Just little things, but evidence nonetheless - an opened window, a half-eaten sandwich that she was sure had been untouched early that morning, a used toothbrush, a coffee-stained mug lying in the sink, and once, a slight opening in the hatch to the attic that she never used.", "It didn't take Anjuli long to start selling her paintings. They were beautiful enough to sell in themselves, but with the story behind them of the artist who seemed to sleepwalk through the painting process, they sold faster than Anjuli could even produce them. A still life one day, a portrait of a sparrow the next, even Anjuli could not predict what would be coming.", "However, it was with a flicker of unease that she opened her eyes one afternoon to her latest sketch. She had recently been featured in a double-page newspaper article, and nothing that had been shown in the article, nothing at all, even came close to the portrait that lay in front of her. The trees that were customary of many of her paintings were still there, but dark and twisted, casting contorted shadows over the rest of the sheet. Red eyes peered from the darkness, their pupils slit-like and dead. And in spiky, twisted letters that at first seemed to blend in with the tree trunks, Anjuli read one word: 'watching'.", "Anjuli did not try to sell that painting. But over the weeks that followed, the hidden corner of her desk where she had thrust the offending landscape accumulated more and more pictures. A figure, stalking closer and closer, a blood-stained dagger etched with perfect precision, a dead woman with her hand falling over the side of a bed, her hair tangled and matted with blood.", "Anjuli started to dread her black-outs, in a way she hadn't since they'd first begun, afraid to see what she'd wake up to. The swimming head and tightness around her neck that always preceded an episode started to haunt her dreams, and she'd wake up drenched in sweat, gasping for breath with tears prickling the backs of her eyes. She began to spend most of her waking hours pacing around the room, doing anything to keep herself active and unable to slip out of consciousness. But try as she might, she could not keep herself moving forever, and when she sat down...", "The familiar pressure appeared at Anjuli's neck. Instantly, stars began to swim in her vision - but this time, she leapt to her feet, crying out as her elbow collided hard with her desk. She spun round, and nearly toppled over in horror.", "A figure stood behind her chair, gloved hands stretched out.", "Anjuli shrieked, pressing herself further backwards into her desk, her arms tightening reflexively around her stomach.", "\"Who-? What-?\" She opened her mouth to scream again, but a hand clamped itself over her jaw.", "\"Quiet,\" the man hissed. His clothes were tattered, hanging loosely off his thin frame, and a days' worth of stubble peppered his jaw.", "Anjuli tried to shout, but only a muffled moan escaped against his hand. Her eyes flitted desperately around the room, at the sheet of paper that was held, slightly crumpled, in the man's other hand, and at the hatch that hung open in the ceiling of the corridor outside... Pieces started to slot together in Anjuli's head, and tears spilled silently from her eyes.", "\"I've had enough...\" the man whispered. His eyes darted dizzyingly to and fro, giving him a restless, unhinged look. \"My paintings were a payment to you, a thank you, if you like... I should have predicted that you would take credit for them, the swollen head that you have...\"", "Anjuli squeaked, her nails scrabbling against his fingers.", "\"I thought you deserved it, you being kind enough to let me stay here, to feed me when I sent you to sleep... But you were just using me, weren't you?\" His voice hardened. \"Living off my talent while you let me rot in that cold, empty attic.\"", "Anjuli tried to bite his hand, but she couldn't even get her mouth to open. She swung her fists wildly into his stomach, but he barely even seemed to notice.", "His hand gripped her jaw painfully, and his lip twisted. \"No more.\"", "His eyes bored into hers, a cold, electric blue. His spare hand reached up to caress her face gently with one thumb. Slowly, softly, it crept down to her neck, and began to tighten around her throat.", "I tipped back the handle of bourbon, suckling the last trickling drops from the neck like a dry man in the desert. As I got the last of it into my mouth, I grimaced. It had been a long night again, it seemed. When I came home from the store, the bottle was full and I had only intended to drink a finger or two to take the edge off a day of beating concrete and hitting up galleries.", "Even a successful artist has to bust their ass to pay rent. We can't all be Jackson Pollock, painting squares that sell for property deeds and gold plated yachts. My particular niche is pictures of the New York skyline. Cliche, I know, but people love it. Especially since I live in Kansas City, where New York is treated by the locals as having a sort of exoticism. But it's not all good, some still consider NYC a mix of angry anti-refugee ads and an oxycontin fever dream.", "I've lived in Kansas City, Misery, for five years. Why? Because of the blackouts. When it started I was up and coming, five feet off Broadway living in a closet next to a restaurant that sold raw meat to rich people. I had my big break and then... nothing. One show that sold like hotcakes, which I also ate for the first time in the three years since the art academy. Even as I ate and money trickled away, in a two-closet apartment a little north of the old one, I couldn't paint. Sure, I could churn out the occasional starving artist's sale work, that's how I kept eating. Barely. But not the ", " stuff. It was the product of that miniscule drop of viscous juice I supped from my muse, that left me flying and covered in paint like a maniac.", "Frustrated, I threw the glass handle, a relic from a whole different era of alcoholism, at the newest canvas. It shattered against the easel behind it, one made of old household pipes I bolted to the floor after a previous rage destroyed the last. How many had it been? Twenty? Thirty easels? I climbed to my feet and stalked across the glass, blood smearing behind my feet as I passed the long wall of recent attempts nailed up in a vicious, self-loathing chronology.", "The first was returned to me, a skyline against matte black, spattered in fine droplets that took days to line up and get right. At street level there were tiny dots left to represent the coming and going of people. Even a perfected, flattened, artistic skyline must show its population in some way. With lights on or direct symbols. Something, else it's not a city. It's just a big collection of buildings! That was the last one that made sense to me!. ", "\"Fuck!\" I screamed at the wall. \"Why?!\"", "The next was months, but the next sooner, and sooner again. Like a countdown where each interval cut itself in half with a palette knife, scraping my soul out to mix it with the umber. Each interval left me waking from a blackout, a painting on front of me. Each bigger than the last, eat in higher detail and clarity. Each in a darker palette, with colors I didn't remember mixing or even buying. Like I was going crazy and the only reflection was on the linen I reserved for paying customers. Between the blackouts, I was fine. Life was normal. Empty, full of limp-wristed painting, but fine.", "Each painting after the first on the wall was darker as I circled the room, each wall covered, trailing through my own blood numbly again and again. ", "New York City with no people, cut in pristine, perfect lines.", "\nNew York City with turned cars, stripped, broken, derelict.", "\nNew York City at night, with no light, shadow or dynamic.", "\nNew York City at high noon, on fire, sky of smoking ash.", "\nNew York City in the evening, buildings leveled, broken.", "\nNew York City in the morning, water eating the shores.", "\nNew York City covered in vines, green on gray cracks.", "\nNew York City covered in twigs, brown, starved.", "\nNew York City swimming, an ocean of black oil.", "\nNew York City rising from a tide of corpses.", "\nNew York City sinking beneath waves.", "\nNew York City no more, just ocean.  ", "The latest was at night.  ", "A black canvas bursting with stars.  ", "I fell to my knees and held my face in my hands, fingers matted with acrylic and tears. I was a thousand miles from home, and in my dreams, it no longer existed. How long until my dreams became the world?", "Eloquent and endearing, each stroke carried a vibrancy of colorful congruence. Her mind\u2019s eye had already visualized it, but seeing the brilliance gradually materializing on the canvas was something else entirely. ", "Like a stiff coryph\u00e9e on a private stage of white ice, the brush swayed and pirouetted, leaving trails of flamboyant pigment in its wake. Red like the lips of a stalwart opera singer; maroon like the royal cape of King Arthur; violet like the Damascus sky at sunset \u2013 color was merely a vessel for ideas, and the canvas a province for expression. ", "Whenever Fiona painted she entered a trancelike state \u2013 it had been like that since her childhood. It was an unwavering place in the storm of life\u2019s uncertainties. More importantly, though, it cured her briefly of her disease. As weird as it might seem, the shapes and forms were an antidote to the chronic poison in her veins. It was a curse and a blessing at the same time, and the byproduct was a broad range of beautiful paintings.", "Fiona felt the strange sickness slowly shrinking away. It was as if each touch and dip drained her face of fever spots, and every sweeping arc replenished her strength. Soon all trace of the depression had disappeared. Once again she felt young and healthy.", "She closed her eyes for a moment, allowing the brush to produce arrays of tranquil innovation on the smooth surface. This right here was every painter\u2019s wet dream \u2013 to let go of inhibition and self-doubt, and just let the image craft itself \u2013 measured but casual; ardent but soothingly invigorating. This right here was art in the purest form. Fiona smiled and opened her eyes. ", "Something was not right. At first, her mind had a hard time comprehending the visual input. This had never happened to her before. Normally the first impression of her finished work was exclusively positive.", "\u201cNo, this\u2026 this is all wrong!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is not what I painted\u2026 this is\u2026\u201d ", "Her voice trailed off. The ghastly face that glared up at her from the canvas was like nothing she had ever seen before. The size and shape resembled that of a small child, but that was where the similarity ended. Glowering eyes of hatred, hollow bony cheeks, and a demonic mouth that nullified the meaning of innocence. ", "She felt her heart hammering distantly. The canvas was a sacred place \u2013 her sanctuary. How had this horrible face managed to encroach on her painting without her consent?", "\"It happened again.\" ", "The look on the artist's face was one of intense misery. Her eyes were turned away. Jeffrey adjusted the hideous green-and-yellow tie, which, he decided, definitely had to go. Tomorrow he would buy something decent and give this ", " back to Richie, even if the interview went badly. ", "\"This time, I was in the elevator on my way up. Next thing I know...\" she trailed off, pointing at the covered canvas. Jeffrey tried to project comfort at her, relaxing his shoulders in the ill-fitting suit, and did his best impression of a soothing tone.", "\"Sometimes you get really caught up in an idea, you know? I've seen you just get distracted sometimes, and then it's like you don't hear a word anyone says. And it's like that thing, highway hypnosis or something? When you're driving a route you've taken a million times and you suddenly lose track of time and you're there already. It happens to me too. They call that highway hypnosis, right?\" ", "In fact, it had never happened to him, but he thought he'd read something like that once. Maria shook her head, dark hair shading her averted gaze. \"This is different. It's not...\"", "Abruptly, she strode over to the far wall, tautly controlled, and turned over a series of four paintings. Their surfaces had been pressed to the wall, heedless of potential damage, very unlike her usual careful treatment of her work. ", "\"I've showed you the first two before, right?\" ", "Jeffrey nodded, perusing the set with genuine interest. He rubbed his newly clean-shaven face gingerly. He would still make the interview, he had two hours, no problem.  ", "\"Sure, before you told me about the, uh, blackouts? I figured you were trying something new. I thought they were kind of freaky... with the shadows all twisted, and that's blood on the wall? But isn't there a good market for this kind of thing? Like... that guy, with the name I can never remember. Anyway, your stuff is fucking ", ", Maria. I bet you could kind of, carve out a niche for yourself, you know, like--\"", "There was something in the last two pictures. They all depicted more or less the same scene: in the first, a nondescript wooden floor by a dusty window, half of a shadowed doorway on the right side, the corner of a picture frame visible on the left. It was obviously Maria's studio, and that would be the door to the closet where she kept rarely used tools, extra supplies and scraps of wood. Outside the door--in the painting, not in real life--were streaks of what appeared to be blood, trailing down the doorframe and into the closet as if dragged by a despairing hand. Strange angular shadows gave the image a curiously offputting quality--Jeffrey, whose interest in visual art other than Maria's rarely went farther than taking pictures with his cellphone camera, wasn't sure why. Something to do with the perspective, perhaps.", "The second picture showed the same corner of the studio, but the shadows seemed to fall differently--and a larger portion of the darkened doorway was visible. ", "The third presented the doorway in full, and two strange, textured dots in the center of the darkness. Some shade of purple, or maroon?  ", "The fourth one added the indistinct outline of a figure squatting in the doorway. Those oddly-colored dots were its eyes. Frankly, Jeffrey found it disturbing... something about the silhouette was seriously amiss. Perhaps whatever nightmare vision Maria had captured here would prove profitable, but he could not call it pleasant to look at. The thing in the doorway was holding something limp at the end of one of its outstretched limbs, dangling from what might be claws.", "\"I didn't want to tell you at first because it scared me. I thought I might have a brain tumor or something... I've never had anything like this happen before. But they were ", ", the paintings were ", ", so I didn't say anything and I just kept going. Then, even when I did the fourth one, I told myself nothing was wrong. I figured it was just like sleepwalking, or sleep sex, or the... highway hypnosis, like you said, and maybe I was unconsciously imitating one of those people who do horror artwork, even though I don't really like that stuff. But then--\" her voice began to tremble as she neared the end. Jeffrey took a step towards her but she backed away, keeping him at a distance. ", "\"Then I woke up after painting the fifth one, I woke up holding the brush and looked at it and--that's not me. That's not something I would ever imagine. It wasn't ", ". So I called you.\" Her face crumpled. \"I called you. I'm sorry.\"", "She sounded so forlorn that Jeffrey wanted to take her in his arms, to tell her everything was going to be ok, but something about the set of her shoulders stopped him. He looked again at the covered canvas. Maria was looking away from him, away from the paintings. Something was wrong. ", "\"I called you, and I just wanted you to come so I wouldn't be alone, with your stupid leather jacket and your stupid beard and... I just wanted you to come. But then I saw you.\" She glanced at him for a moment, for the first time since she'd brought him into the studio, then looked away, as if the sight hurt her.", "\"Wait a minute--you're upset about the way I ", "?\" Jeffrey sputtered in confusion. \"Like I told you, I have the interview for the office gig, and it's not like they're going to hire Mr. Hell's Angels--this is my brother's stupid cheap suit. I'm going to get another one! So you painted a bad dream, it's weird... but come on, what's the big deal?\" ", "Maria, still refusing to look at him, pointed at the covered canvas. With a sigh, Jeffrey grasped one corner of the covering sheet and pulled it off in a single motion. Then he stared for quite a while.", "The fifth painting displayed almost the same scene as the previous one. The same room, the same doorway, the same bloody markings on the wall. But this time, no light came through the window. It was black outside; the entire room was cast into shadow. Yet what lay behind the doorway was clearly visible: it was not Maria's supply closet. It was somewhere else entirely. And the figure inside it, the horrible, leering figure--", "Was holding an ugly, green-and-yellow tie in its dripping claw.", "Outside, all the lights went out.

It was always gratifying to be able to find a solution to the puzzles I faced, without having to beg for help from any of demons or Old Gods. It was a matter of professional pride.", "On the other hand, I felt a twinge of sadness for Mr Hrulam. Perhaps it was true what they said after all, that it was our most tortured artists and geniuses who produced the most groundbreaking, redefining pieces of art.", "\u201cMr Hrulam, I may have gotten it wrong.

There was nobody, as expected.", "Inside, I see the picture I had made. It was familiarly macabre. Dark pools of blood on an old wooden floor, a chair in the middle of an otherwise empty room.

Check. The easel was all set up with the blank canvas. Check. A paint stained rag in which to wipe my brushes, accompanied with the spirits. Check. My favorite purple lighter, for when I needed a little inspiration, and with it, my rubber tourniquet, a spoon, a clean syringe. Check.

I felt... anxious when I looked at it. I couldn't explain what I felt if I tried, it was a painting of the city I lived in. It was dimly lit and the colors were desaturated.

Maybe that's why my paintings were turning sad. I wasn't treating my body right and my unconcious mind was suffering for it.

I drifted asleep after gazing at the ceiling for what seemed like hours, although I wasn't keeping track.", "I awoke the next morning sore and stiff. I felt strange, I looked around and noticed I was on the floor, had I fallen off the bed? I felt around for my glasses. My hands searched nearby until I gripped the frame and put them on.

My breathing slowed as I began to calm myself.", "This has happened before, but this time felt different, it felt scary and I felt uncomfortable in my own skin. For once I didn't feel in control.

I needed to get out for a bit.", "I walked out to down the street. I came to the spot of the painting's perspective. I felt nervous standing there.

It felt so good to eat and I was in total bliss for the duration of my meal. I felt awesome after washing the last of my food down with a hot coffee. Maybe that's what I really needed was a delicious hearty meal. I felt like painting again really badly so I jogged back to my apartment. I cracked open a few windows and opened the curtains. My studio felt alive, it was cheerful and bright. I was in the perfect mood to paint.", "I proceeded to pick up a brush and focus. I learned to control it in order to induce the blackouts. I focused hard and breathed in time with the breeze outside of the window and drifted off. I could feel something take over my body and begin to move just as I faded away.", "My eyes opened. I couldn't tell the passage of time. But it was dim in the studio. My body finished the last stroke as my brain reactivated. I peered closely at the image before me. My attitude from earlier drained from me. It was replaced by panic. The image splayed out before my eyes was... me, sitting in this exact moment staring at this exact painting from behind.

I'd never really been able to put anything much down on paper in terms of art, although I always felt like I had artistic capabilities hidden inside. Anyway, this one day I was writing a paper -the night before it was due no less-, and it was about some stupid war in the 1800's. At the time, I thought I'd fallen asleep, but looking back now I know it was my first blackout. I was about halfway though the paper when I checked the handout, to ensure I was still within the guidelines. As it happened, I had misread the instructions and essentially had to re-start. As I'm sure you've experienced - my blood started to boil. I didn't care about the 1800's, or this class. I hated my teacher, and I was done. I don't remember going to sleep, but when I woke up the next morning, my desk was covered in 2\" high origami soldiers, folded neatly from what used to be my history textbook.

You saw it yourself!\" I protested, my head hurting, trying to sift through the countless examples of illegal masterpieces that followed my origami army.

The gap in our eyewitness accounts only gives you maybe 10, 15 minutes to have done this. Your house of cars is beautiful, but we need answers - people are getting upset.

We think the weight of the pile merged the lower cars together.\" ", "I woke up that night to a bright flash of light.

Most people have experienced the feeling of being watched when they're in front of a professional portrait. There's an optical illusion where it looks like the eyes are following you. This is very natural. What isn't natural is getting this feeling from a landscape. Yet, there I was with such a predicament.", "It was one of the simpler ones I had done. Imagine if the African plains had curving bluffs and octagonal sections of dense rain forest. Then I noticed it; there was a single lidless eye subtly painted in one of the trees. It seemed like it was almost intentionally camouflaged in the pitted bark. That was pretty eerie since I never remember painting these, but who am I to argue with sleeping me when he's the one who pays the bills? At least, that's what I reasoned in my head at the time.", "After that, every painting had anywhere from one eye to 7 in it. They were usually integrated seamlessly into the landscape, hidden in the leaves or the bark or the stones. Most people didn't notice the eyes themselves, but you could see the discomfort in their body language at my showings. It started taking longer to sell my paintings, but they were going for a higher price. Apparently they became really popular in the fringe occult crowd. You would be surprised what kinds of strange hobbies the exuberantly rich can afford.", "This was how it went for years. I would paint a pretty landscape that had creepy eyes in it, it would sit on auction for months, then it would be snatched up for double the asking price out of nowhere. I couldn't complain until today. Today is an entirely different story. This morning I woke up mid-creation if I can even call it that. The terrain looked like something I would usually draw, but the sky was something else. Just looking at it made my head hurt. It was as if I were being forced to look at a color that didn't exist or a shape with no edges or curves. The only thing I could make out clearly was a face with an ever-changing number of eyes and a grin that spoke of anything but joy.", "I can't stand looking at it anymore. Every time I try to turn it away from me, I find myself turning it back around. Whenever I try to leave the room, I find myself carrying it with me. I tried to slash it with a steak knife, but my freshly bandaged thigh is testament to how that went, and I swear I heard giggling as I swore and cursed after stabbing myself. ", "I can't take it. It won't leave me alone. It hurts just to look at, and it won't let me stop looking. I want to stop, but I find myself drawn to it in a way, like it's calling to me.

His final writings reveal how he became his final masterpiece.", "I woke up next to my bed, distraught, confused, covered in blood.\nWhat was this incessant throbbing all over my body? Why was I hurting? I asked myself. I picked myself up off the floor to see the monstrosity which had been created in my absence of mind. My Monalisa, not confined to a frame but proliferated over every surface. It began to grow, the most beautiful, intrinsically visceral; literally visceral art I've ever created. It consumed the floor beneath me, darkened and dampened every surface I'd interact with; until my life energy would lend itself to the final stroke, the last splotch of life on my lifeless canvas.\nPainting with life, as I lay here dead; My art will die with me in decomposition. The art of my entire life, released onto the greatest canvas of them all. Entropy. Chaos. Death.\nThe greatest piece of art in the universe had already created itself; but was not yet complete. It would not be complete until it destroyed itself and lent itself to new art; rebirth.\nSigned, Carlos", "Pain emanated from knots in my neck and spin as I regained consciousness. I know my posture is terrible, and I try and work on it when I can; but it seems like that is the least of the concerns of whatever gets a hold of me during my blackouts. I arced my back, hearing several fleshy pops. As soon as the acks abated, I looked onto  my easel. As always, it was covered in a pristine, white cloth, just barley covering the entire surface of whatever was under it. I looked at the dried palate that was my palms; I long gave up understanding how it remained so clean, and only now and again I remember that I before the blackouts started neither me or my wife had seen this cloth before.  ", "I stumbled onto my feat, and began hobbling towards my newest masterpiece. When the blackouts started, I struggled to call these paintings mine; they were a drastic departure from my established style and I felt like I didn't work a all to produce them. Now I struggle to call them mine because I desperately hope that the contents do not reflect me in anyway. More exacerbated than fearful, I warily wondered what monstrosity lay before me today; the souls of the damned screaming in agony? I chuckled morbidly; only if I was lucky. At least those paintings were stylized, abstract, and people would actually buy them. As of late,my paintings had been growing increasingly realistic, and the subject horrifically familiar. Maybe this time a friend or family member will only be badly beaten instead of vivisected. ", "As I worked up the nerve to complete this wicked ritual, I noticed a yellow piece of paper adhered to the ghastly textile. I wondered how I didn't notice it before. Had I left myself a note? Somewhat relived I had an excuse to prolong the inevitable, I carefully peeled off the post-it note, making sure not to disturb the cloth. Don't look at it Don. My heart dropped into my stomach. Despite the rushed, panicked penmanship,I could tell this was my wife's handwriting. I might have shouted some obscenity if I could push through my lips a single syllable as my throat closed up. Even as products of my black-outs grew worse and worse, she refused to be left in the dark as to what I wanted; I tried to protect her, but she wanted to deal with this together. So she has seen everything, even the worst.", "I heard water boiling upstairs, in the kitchen, and tried to convince myself that this somehow made things okay. I ran out of the basement and rushed into an empty house. The water had been boiling for at least an hour, and from the windows I could see that my wife's car was gone. I thought about searching through the house aimlessly, trying to search for her even though she wasn't there, but I looked back towards basement door, the stairs descending into my studio. I felt pulled, compelled, pulled into the doorway by a force equal to the maw of a lion. I walked down the stairs, the easel still there, waiting patiently for my return.

I was going there to get a change in life.\nLately my paintings have been plain, a bowl of apples, lemons, grapes. I have had a hard time finding inspiration. While I was walking along the Savannah there was a strange woman. She looked like she was a native but the markings on her face where different. I decided to follow the woman seeking an adventure. She crawled into a small space just between two boulders, and I lost her. I tried to follow but once I peeked inside something hit my eye, and I blacked out. I woke up later on, with my right eye covered. The tour Gide was standing to the left of the cot I was it, staring. \"What happened?\" I blurted out sounding confused \"we had noticed you where not in the group, we had a search party go looking for you. We couldn't find you for 3 days, we went back to the spot where we lost you and found you handing by your feet. Luckily we found you in time.\" The tour guide Said with a worried smile. That's strange, I don't remember anything.. ", "The next day I decided to bring out my oil paints, I sat down and suddenly blacked out. I woke up sitting in the chair with my brush in hand, the painting was complete. It was the boulders but with a strange red tint to it, and also with a white light coming out. \"That's weird, I don't remember painting this\" there was a knock on the door. The tour guide came in with his bag in hand \"it's almost time to leave, pack up your things and we'll be off\" he said with a smile. I carefully put away my oil paint and put my painting in the bag, I was happy to go home and leave the memories of the woman and the boulders behind. When i finally Arrive home, to my  empty apartment in the city, I pulled out my painting and looked at it, I turned my attention to a blank canvas. I pulled out the paints and sat, then once again I blacked out. I woke up on the floor this time, I jumped up and took a look at the new painting, it was the same woman from Africa. Her face was beautiful, her bright blue eyes, the red markings on her face, what did it mean? I went to sleep soon after that, before I did I put the painting face down so I wouldn't feel like I was being watched. I woke up the next morning with a new canvas in my hands. I blacked out once again. I awoke this time by the window, the sun was setting, I must have been out for a while. Remembering the canvas I looked to the left, there sat the new painting. This time, the woman was in the small space between the boulders, in a cave. I'll never forget the thing behind her.. It was me, with the same bandage over my right eye, and the same clothes that I was wearing. I heard the floor creak, I spun around.. And there stood the woman, with the strange markings on her face. I now know what they mean. The marking that looked like a blade of glass meant death, the hands meant To, and the sphere, meant death to all.

I would not.", "Brown. That hazel color would always return to my brush. I make the color fly across the canvas, and soon cocoa pools open from the white cover.

His eyes will never meet mine. He will never look at me the way that he looks at a girl- because I am another boy. He will look away in disgust.", "The canvas changes shape. He is more beautiful than ever, but his eyes- they do not change. Forever looking away at something more bright. ", "It doesn't seem correct to me.", "I can feel myself fading away.

Red stretches on for miles, and I look at my hands, now stained with red. ", "My now crimson hands lift the painting forwards- it's not alone. His body lies peacefully on the desk now too.

On it are etchings of a star and crescent moon and beneath there is a small pool of red. \"Those,\" he says still pointing, his face peeled back in a smile that reminds me of the rabid dog my father shot when I was nine. \"They're the same as the ones on the boy's blanket.\" ", "Waking up one day to a painting of a hallway full of dead bodies... a complete massacre... all of them resembling your neighbors, and you after staring at it, feel a cold shiver running down your spine as you walk to the apartment door, and before reaching the knob, a blood trail and some paint tubes are on the corner of the door, which is half opened... sweat running through your forehead, reach the knob", "I woke up on the living room floor infront of the fire place in my shorts, my body covered in paint AGAINN.

This painting was more vivid than the others i had to sit and calm down, for some reason i was suffering from a shortness of breath. I was analyzing the painting when suddenly i noticed something which i would have never noticed if i had been standing, sitting down looking at it from an angle i noticed a 2nd layer on top of the painting, an untrained eye would have missed it but to me it was as bright as day. A quick analysis and i had found a chilling message in the painting which could have only been for me, i left the room unable to look at the painting and headed straight to the kitchen.\n4 hours, 2 packs of marlboro and a bottle of jack later i still didnt know what to make of the message \"you enjoyed her last year on this day, i enjoyed her today, we are similar my friend you and i, we both made her scream thats for sure..... sorry for the obvious message this time but its 12-0 to me its time you started to participate in my game dear friend....\" .............", "Look, it's not hard. Slap some paint on a canvas and name it after some social movement. Fucking Jackson Pollock did it right? That fucker just threw paint like it was nothing! But you see, this is why I had to go back to school. Literally, there are millions of artists out there. I did have some success but once I got married and had a family I was only inspired to paint my life. Yes. Yes, I do like painting my kids and family. No! It's not sad at all. Why would you think that? Because kids grow up so fast? Eh. It happens. And believe me, getting them to sit still long enough to do a quick sketch could drive anyone crazy. I think that's why I decided to learn psychology. I like the idea of helping people out. It does take a lot of my time being here with you but I know my family understands.

And they do make me want to hug David even tighter at night. And I started taking a new vitamin for energy. Now I'm not really sure if this is it or not but it's like I'm able to even work in my sleep.

You're the professor, I'm sure you are busy with many other students. I just wondered if you had any idea what this could be.

No they've never been that dark. NO. I don't think anything like that could have happened. What's wrong with you? Don't even speak like that. DO NOT PUT THAT OUT THERE. I'm very superstitious.

The rains that had approached with the coming of the seasonal storms were unusually strong this year, deterring most of the usual tourists and I was closing up for the night besides. But I saw a shadow by the door and the glow of a lantern. ", "There was a knock. I wiped my hands down and made for the doorway. ", "\"Excuse me, I'm looking for a room.\" ", "It took me a second to register he'd spoken. He looked normal enough for a traveller, ragged cloak and unkempt hair. There was a sword at his side but that was not unusual too- the roads were dangerous after all, full of bandits and wild animals. ", "No, it was that gentle smile on his face. It looked vaguely familiar, I thought I'd seen it somewhere before. ", "\"Come on in, I have a room or two to spare.\" I said nonetheless. I wasn't going to leave someone braving the vicious storm outside if I could help it. Besides, the bag of coins he'd jingled when he spoke told of some substantial wealth. \"Something to eat and drink too perhaps. It's a cold night out there.\" ", "\"Ah, thank you.\" ", "He was soft spoken. He walked with a tall, elegant gait, not at all like the travellers I usually met.

Juha's a pretty quiet place, even for a bay town. I guess the only thing's that happened recently is the Leviathan corpse they're trying to haul into the bay.\" ", "I even laughed then, \"You needn't have hurried for that. The Knight and his troops have been waiting for days too- it's too difficult to move something that big into the bay with the winds as they are. They're trying to arrange transporters from the Capital.\" ", "\"So, the Leviathan is dead already.\" ", "I didn't notice his tone. I should have. ", "\"Well, yeah. Sir Calstrum had to battle it out at sea for a day or so but he's a tough one. All the Queen's Knights are, I suppose.

Ahead, the tiny ship bobbed like a twig on the endless sea. They rapidly closed in on it. The captain gave the orders for the men to board.

", "\"Captain,\" said Jonathan, \"Should I get the men to row? We can only be a da-\"", "\"Hush!\" commanded Christian. \"Listen! Do you hear that?\"", "\"I don't hear-\" Jonathan began, before his face dropped. \"I hear it. It hangs in the air like a bird of prey. It's him, isn't it?\"", "Christian slowly shook his head. It couldn't be. They were almost a week away from him now. If he was still alive, he was too far away for them to hear his playing.", "There was a single man on board. He was calm, even in the face of a cutlass. Perhaps he wanted it ended. They took what few supplies he had, and the two wedding bands he had in his pocket. They would be worth something. They put the man in a launch boat - a tiny vessel with two oars. They gave him three days worth of water, perhaps more if he rationed well, and half a dozen biscuits. \"Please,\" he asked Christian, \"my fiddle. Let me play for my wife one last time. Agatha loved the sea. I come every year to play for her.\" The story meant nothing to Christian, but the fiddle was cheap and scratched and worth nothing. Christian let him have it. Then, they burned his ship and set him adrift in the tiny boat.", "Darkness came as quickly as if someone had closed a curtain. Christian looked up, hoping for a glimpse of the moon behind a cloud. But there were no clouds, no moon, and no stars. The sky was empty. Dead", "\"Captain,\" said Jonathan, his voice uneasy and as creaky as the ship, \"It's the fiddler. We should have killed him.\"", "There was a chorus of agreement from the other men on deck. A single droplet of rain fell on Christian's hand.

Two days since they had taken his rings. \"I'm sorry Agatha,\" he whispered into the night, \"I've let you down.\" He was long out of water and food, and his lips were more cracked than whole. The wind whispered a reply, ", ", it said. \"Agatha?\" ", ". He picked up the fiddle with his withered, ruined hands, and he played her song.", "The storm came out of nowhere. A tempest of red rain rattled the boards of the ship whilst wind ripped at the sails and whistled through the bow. And behind the dreadful storm, still the rising and falling in the night like a wave of panic, the fiddle played. The music washed into Christian's bones and through his very soul. There were screams from his crew, and he steadied himself against the wind and fought his way to the aft. He saw what they were afraid of.", "A huge hungry maelstrom swirled and bubbled behind the boat, pulling it ever inwards, towards its centre. A bedlam of water swirled and swished and ripped at the fabric of the sea. Men jumped overboard, as Christian ran to the wheel and furtively tried to fight the irresistible tug of the sea.", "The pirate ship was not seen again. But it is said that on the calmest nights out on sea, if you listen carefully and cock an ear to the wind, you might hear the furtive notes of the fiddle player, as he sails the sea, forever looking for his love.

It was my first time as gun captain on one of the triple 16-inch guns. It had been easy: make sure nothing was in sight that way, point the gun in that direction, and fire. If I was lucky, I had thought at the time, it would be the first AND last time I ever had to be in charge of those guns firing. ", "The day before that night, the clouds started rolling our way. They were monstrous grey things spewing lightening and the wind coming off then hit fifty knots before we even saw the first drop of rain.

They are a mere hundered nautical miles west. We can hit them no and make it look like the storm did it.\" As if to underscore his point, a crack of lighting snaked across the sky and thunder boomed across the ocean.", "The Captain's smile had faded. \"Sir, respectfully, we have been ordered to cease offensive action. The war is all but over. Those sailors have families to go home to as well.\"", "The FFC spat. \"To hell with them. With all of them! We attack. Turn this fleet toward theirs and make preparations for combat. Now!\" His eyes darted about the bridge. \"Crafty bastards might have us bugged. We have to act before they can act on their Intel!\" His eyes were wild and unfocused. His anger was blinding him to reason.

Even with the element of surprise, sir, we cannot expect to...\"", "The FFC was shouting now. The bridge had gone otherwise silent. \"Obey my orders captain or I will have you relieved!\"", "Color rose in the Captain's cheeks. He stood and straightened his uniform. \"Sir, perhaps we should continue this discussion outside. It is he only place we can be sure to speak freely.\" ", "The FFC merely nodded and headed for the weather deck.

I don't want to loose you.\"", "The three of us quickly dawned life jackets and headed through the hatch to the weather deck. The sea rolled, leapt and dove beneath us. The sky was black but for the lightning. I lit up my watch and checked the lunar function, a habit of mine before going outside at night. It was a new moon tonight. Above he clouds the star would be dazzling. ", "\"Wait here.\" The captain put his hand on my shoulder and looked me in the eye with an earnestness I had never seen. \"What here son. I'll talk him down. We won't be having a battle tonight.\"", "I nodded and the captain walked with the grace of a dancer on the rolling deck toward the life lines, on which the FFC was leaning, waiting for the captain. I posed the hatch behind us and the darkness became nearly complete. ", "Over the roar of the storm I could hear nothing but for flashes of lightning I could see nothing. Thanks sea wracked the ship with a fury I hadn't seen in all my days. I waited uneasily for the two high up brass to decide our fate. The captain had been right: to attack would mean out death. And perhaps and end to the peace talks. ", "Minutes felt like hours as the rain lashed down. Finally I saw a figure working its way back to me. I opened the hatch to gain some light and dark the captain returning alone. In his hand was a life jacket. The FFC's life jacket. We stepped hurriedly into the ship. ", "I was heading back for the bridge when the captain grabbed me and held me in place. \"He fell overboard. I reached out for him and grabbed a hold of his life jacket but it ripped off. He fell into the sea. I will proceed to the bridge and sound man overboard. You get safety gear ready for the deck lookouts.\" ", "He handed the life jacket to me and headed for the bridge at a stroll. I looked down at the jacket, then back to my beloved captain. I set the clasps back in place and wrenched hard, tearing the securing straps from the jacket. The captain was right. The FFC had fallen overboard. ", "A week later we pulled into home port. The war was over. I never went to sea again.", "One night, when I was a young man travelling with my family, I had made my mind up to go for a swim. We were visiting friends who lived on a small island in the middle of a lake vast in size, a thousand feet deep, a hundred leagues long and fifty leagues across. The water was calm, small waves lazily caressed the small sand beach I stood on and the water as far as I could see was like a soft mirror of the black sky, broken up with specks of white froth and reflections of moon and star. ", "As often is the case, I was alone. I didn't think twice about wading into the chilly waters until I was waist deep before I let myself slide forward into a small wave, like collapsing into a bed, and began to slowly swim out. Though I was still young and physically small I was a strong swimmer, growing up on a lake I've always been very comfortable in the water. ", "By the time I stopped my relaxed swim and stopped, treading water and catching my breath I had gone much farther than intended and carried laterally by the current. I could still see the island, though I could barely spy the lights from the cabin windows it was enough, I had my bearings. I spun myself back around, back turned to the island and marveled at the beauty of the cloudless night sky and nothing but rolling water as far as I could see. ", "I flipped over on my back and stared at the stars as I swam eastward, correcting the drift from the current, completely overwhelmed with beauty I wondered if the miracle of my life was as meaningful as the miracle of this lake. How would you even measure such a thing, the value of a miracle? I laughed and got a mouthful of water, stopping my backstroke I tread water once more and spit the water out. ", "I very quickly noticed I was bobbing up and down much more as I scissored my legs and waved my arms. Turning myself back to face the island, it took a few moments to spot the light from the cabin window. The light. There was only one on, my family would soon be in bed and there would be no lights. You can understand this is a troubling realization to someone who's only begun to live their life. The wind and waves steadily increasing in severity did little to calm this realization.", "I began swimming in earnest, telling myself I had to get home before the lights went out or it would take forever to find the beach again. I subconsciously knew I was actually swimming for my life, but I suppose I was trying to keep that fact in denial to stay calm; even at that age I knew the disasters panic can cause. I'm not sure if you've ever tried to swim any great distance at night but it becomes quite difficult to maintain your direction when the waves are larger and stronger than you, I frequently had to stop or slow and push myself up out of the water to see the island. ", "I stopped to catch my breath and give my now aching muscles a break, gauging my distance and direction home. I squinted for a moment and wiped some water from my eye with the back of my hand, when I opened my eyes again the light from the window was gone, the island nothing more than a blurred silhouette only noticeable because it was stationary and darker than the reflective water. ", "My mental denial of the danger I was in went out with that bedroom light and I felt all the elements of panic start to set in. My already racing heart was now beating against my chest, my measured breathing turned instantly to deep gasps that often got bits of water from the waves in my mouth, my hands and arms began trembling and my stomach started to crawl up my throat. I closed my eyes and heard my Father's voice in my head, \"No, breathe. That's it, just breathe nice and easy. In. And out.\" My stomach settled, my heart decided it wanted to stay in my chest, and I knew what I had to do, just breathe and swim. ", "Treading water with my eyes closed and taking those few careful breaths, I saw a bright light through my eyelids and immediately opened them to catch a glimpse of everything in perfect clarity, fully illuminated by a bolt of lightning miles behind me, then with my pupils shocked from the light everything was dark. I felt the reverberation from the thunder in my body before I heard it but when I did hear it, it was as though the sky split open and dumped all it's water back into the lake. I was already swimming, frantically toward the mental afterimage of the island.", "I thought to myself I was over halfway home, and then I thought I was just reassuring myself. The fast moving storm clouds made the moon and start light chaotic and ethereal. I started wondering if the silhouette I was swimming towards was the island or just that clear picture of it I've been holding in my mind. ", "Despite the adrenaline, my legs were aching and felt as if they were pumping pure fire through their veins. I knew if I got a muscle cramp it would probably be the end of me. I stopped swimming and looked to make sure I was still heading toward the island and not just fooling myself and I was indeed. I tread water with my arms only for just a few breaths, letting my legs rest while I waited for a wave to propel me forward. ", "I thought about surfing, I had never done it but I understood the concept well enough. I started feeling the waves with a different mindset, learning how to join with them and stiffen my body to let them carry me with little effort on my part. As I got the hang of it I became excited, the heavy rain and sporadic thunderclaps now background noise. I felt I learned to be one with the water, I had mastered the waves and with that mastery was swimming faster than I ever have before!", "As I drew nearer and nearer to the island it grew larger and became clearer. I had drifted off course again, I was closer to the western point than the beach on the east where the cabin slumbered. I swam eastward again, though I couldn't see the beach I had a good idea of where it was relative to the point and it was a small island. It certainly wasn't as easy to swim across the waves as it was to swim with them, but my muscles had rested some and I still stiffened my body for moments to let the waves carry me closer to shore. ", "Then the sky light up again, another lightning bolt to the north, I took another clear reckoning of the island with the brief illumination. I could see the beach and I couldn't be more than a hundred yards from it! I turned to face it and with the next wave I used my arms and legs to launch myself forward with it, stiffening my body and letting it carry me as I periodically kicked or fanned my arms to stay with it or on course. Then I lost it, the whole world rumbled with the thunderous boom of the last lightening bolt as I waited for the next wave I would harness.", "I was racing toward the beach, I could see the sand clearly and the darkness of the vegetation behind it. When I fanned my arms forward I was surprised to feel air and, looking down, I realized I was a full 5 feet above the surface of the water riding the crest of a huge wave. Like the roadrunner realizing he ran straight off a cliff, I dropped down into the water, half in the wave and half in the air as I fell. ", "I immediately began doing the breast stroke to keep direction, though I was barely moving my arms and legs my momentum was carrying me to the shore faster than any human could swim. I felt the sand and small rocks scrape my face and mash my nose, then my chest and arms and the rest of my body was being dragged across the coarse ground. I went from being completely underwater to feeling air on my back, the wave had carried me right to the shore, I was home! I was alive!", "I planted my palms in the dirt and started to do a pushup, already walking home in my mind. Then the wave that carried me ashore was reclaimed by the lake, the water rapidly slid beneath me and created a vacuum in the space it left between my body and the earth, sucking my face straight into the sand. I tried to push myself up again and another large wave crashed against my back, keeping me down as surely being stomped on. ", "I had been holding my breath too long, since I fell through the wave minutes ago. All I could think of, was that I needed to get my head out of the water before the next wave slammed me down again and I started to push myself up once more. Again the undertow sucked me down into the sand as the last wave receded into the lake, and though I struggled for my life with all my strength the wave was stronger. When the undertow subsided, my efforts to breathe were again beat down as the crest of the next wave smashed against my back. ", "Then the undertow again, my aching arms trembled as I struggled to lift my head out of water just a few inches and breath, I could feel the air on my ears it was so shallow! Just then I remembered all the times I've heard people say a baby can drown in an inch of water and as my lungs went into convulsing spasms and my whole body trembled and felt as though it were collapsing on itself, I realized just how true that was...", "As I walk through the fields of ash and fire I shudder, did I actually do this?\nAll of this? Death... because they took everything from me?", "I shudder and fall to my knees, sobs wracking my frame.\nIt's not right, what I did. ", "A scream tears me out of my thoughts, a person! I have to help them.\nI rush towards the sound and see a young child burned and scarred.\n\"Are you alright young one?\" I ask reaching my hand out with a smile on my face.", "The child starts looking at me with eyes that were slowly widening in fear and horror.\n\"Monster!\" The child screams face full of pain and tears, \"Demon! Get away from me! Don't hurt me!\"", "I startle and retract my hand, his words hurt.\n\"My child, I am no monster I-\"", "\"Liar!\" The child screams shrilly, \"I saw you! The look on your face as you trapped everyone in the town hall! The look on your face as the hall erupted in flames! You have no remorse for their deaths!\"", "I shake my head in denial, \"That is not true! I do have remorse for their deaths!\"", "The child's face then morphs into an angry scowl, \"Then why are you smiling?\"", "I bring my hands up to my face and touch my lips.\nA smile.", "Why am I smiling?

The two were mere yards apart now.", "\u2018With respect, aelder, the reason we might fear a moonless night is because we cannot see.

Chris!\u201d The child looked at his father and saw a worried face. \u201cThe cows got scared by something and they ran away. We need to go and get them.\u201d explained his father.

Chris followed the road to the right and his father went straight ahead.", "\u00a0", "Adrenalin was pumping through Christopher\u2019s heart as his only companion were the trees around him. As he followed the road and the cow prints on the ground, he heard a noise on his right side, he swiftly pointed the flashlight to the origin of the sound. However there was just a tree motionlessly standing. Chris shuck his head and continued deeper into the forest. The noises around him got \u00a0lauder and more frequent. His flashlight wasn\u2019t focused on the cow tracks, but on his surrounding. The combination of a forest and the moonless night made him scared and his focus was all over the place. He looked up into the air and for the first time since he was woken up realized that the moon was hiding.", "\u00a0", "He was lying on his back and staring at the ceiling and remembering that night. Even 20 years later he could still feel the fear in his bones. \u201cWell there goes my sleep!\u201d he proclaimed lauder then he first intended. Chris stood up and made his way to the kitchen.

The storm came out of nowhere and it also disappeared as quickly as it came. It was like all the gods from all the religions in the world decided to unleash their power onto the HMS York. It was a bright day with just a few clouds that divided the sky. The captain was on the deck giving orders to his sailors, when out of nowhere a razor sharp wind appeared. Just a few seconds later, Poseidon and Zeus cursed the clouds and made them black with thunder raining upon the unsuspected Englishmen.

You know grandpa, you thought me many thing, but I never understood this one. Why would you be afraid of the anger of a patient man? However, I had to learn this one the hard way.

As he opened the door he was greeted by a thrashed house, he ran inside and saw his wife in the living room having one of her mood swings. He tried to calm her down, but none of the usual tricks helped. She just kept screaming, crying and swearing at him. Her words still echo through his mind \u201cIT IS ALL YOUR FAULT!\u201d.

Despite his appearance ( a muscular frame sculpted from years of hard work and long jet black beard) he was one of the kindest men I have ever met.

The few strong men in our village couldn't stand up to the garrison of 15 well trained armed men from the castle; which meant there was no one to stop them from being base criminals. It was after around a month of their petty crime (extorting the baker, drinking for free at the inn, and just being a menace to the people) that they first met Raj. ", "I'll never forget the day Raj walked into town pulling a cart of his fresh crops to feed the poor. His massive form was shredded and bulging; straining against the bulk of food he was bringing to town (and the added weight of his daughter on the cart). It would have taken most men using an ox to pull that cart but Raj...well he's Raj. The problems started when Raj began his usual routine of unloading half of his crop into the food bank, a donation for the town. ", "One of the soldiers Mark, a thin framed asshole , approached Raj and jokingly remarked about him being a waste of muscle. Raj merely apologized to the man for his perceived problem and began walking away. The other soldiers seeing the man as weak joined mark spewing insults at Raj and began hitting him as if he was an oxen. Throughout all of this Raj kept a smile on his face and apologized, he only saw the good in men, a fact soon to change. As Raj left for his farm later that evening (covered in small bruises from the switches made by the soldiers) he seemed depleted- as if it had taken the full strength of his soul to accept the punishment he was just meted. I had never seen him look haggard and worn but that night for the first time I saw his age and realized how old he actually was. His daughter was staying the night with an older women who was sick (she was trained in medicine- I don't know how she knew it). ", "The shitbag Mark couldn't leave well enough alone and it was on this night they decided to test their luck. I don't know what happened exactly- I only know what I heard- the soldiers ran into Raj's daughter in the early morning and by the time she got home she had suffered severe trauma. The soldiers assumed Raj was too much of a pussy to do anything and knew the town wasn't strong enough to kick them out. What they didn't plan on... was the anger of a gentle man...or should I say rage.", "Raj came walking down the dusty road into town a few hours later. I could tell it was him because of the size of his form with the sun at his back. He wasn't walking how he normally did, a soft gentle gait, he moved with precision and force. The ground seemed to quake at his approach and the air itself seemed afraid. When he got close enough to see his face I couldn't recognize him- his smile had melted away and a scowl twisted by rage had replaced it. His eyes which were normally filled with light and love were cold and inhuman, his beard normally well kept was twisted and wild. His hands were molded into fists, his muscular arms rippled and his veins bulged under the strain of their form- these fleshy hammers  had been formed from the darkest aspects of his soul. ", "\"Mark \" Raj bellowed with such force that the heavens shook and my body was frozen by fear. The soldier approached him somehow un-phased by this display of sheer power (he was probably too dumb to realize what happened) and placed his hand on Raj's bulging chest. As Mark open his mouth to speak he was met with a thunderous knee to the chest. In one blow Raj had broken half of Mark's ribs and dropped him to his knees. Raj placed his enormous hands on either side of Mark's head and interlocked his fingers tight- with the strength that comes from years of hard work under the sun- and ultimate rage he brought his palms together. Mark's head exploded and flattened like a pancake under the immense pressure; Raj tore out the spine from where Mark's head used to be and with a demonic roar charged the garrison house.

But he was tempermental, in spite of his intentions and better nature. She'd been warned of that. And she'd ignored the warnings. When it all came crashing down, and the jilted and fallen came for Blair's blood, Lunas had felt regret and embarassment, withdrawing from the debacle for her own survival. It broke her heart, and left her mourning yet again, with nobody to share the burden of her grief.", "She found herself thinking of him as they sat over their brunch with their drinks, trying to ignore the empty place at the table and in her heart with her dry wit and appreciation for the others there.", "And then Blair walked in.", "He didn't seem to notice them; if he did, he wasn't going to engage them. He made his way to the far end of the bar, alone, and he sat. Even now, after everything, there was a gentleness to him; he avoided those between him and the bar, clearly making apologies to others, smiling kindly at the barkeep. Others had accused him of such things being a false front; Lunas had never seen him as being false. But, she had to admit, her own bias might have gotten in the way, projecting onto Blair what she wanted to see, both in a dear friend, and in herself.", "Anders and Waren followed her sightline. Waren, for his part, drained his tankard and got to his feet.", "\"No,\" said Lunas, grabbing Waren by the wrist. \"Leave it be. We already got our justice. We already won.

Lunas couldn't tear her eyes away.", "Suddenly, Waren bellowed. \"Gods curse you, answer me, you coward!\"", "The tavern fell silent. All eyes turned to the bar.", "\"I've asked you once,\" came Blair's voice. It was crisp, and eloquent, as the bard had always been. But there was a coldness, too, a hardness that Lunas wasn't used to hearing. Steel was in that voice, in the man's spine. \"I won't ask again. Leave me be.\"", "\"Get out,\" Waren growled. \"You don't belong here. Anywhere near here. You are an outcast.

Just because I refuse to engage in your petty short-sighted emotional goading does not make me a coward. And just because you want to make yourself look better by making me look worse does not make you the better man.\" His jaw tightened, as if he was holding back the fury that had once marked him as a traitor and monster, and he said the next very carefully, enunciating each word deliberately. \"Leave. Me. In. Peace.\"", "Waren roared, and swung with his mug. It was stoneware, heavy, and could crack a man's skull. But Blair was fast. He kicked back from the bar, his stool toppling under him, and he stayed on his feet, long limbs staying balanced. The bard grabbed the stool by the leg as it fell, and he swung it at the veteran, sweeping it to make a clear space. Waren was undeterred, and came at him again. Blair, now with the stool in both hands, shoved the seat towards the veteran. It was not as damaging a weapon as the mug, but it had reach. It caught Waren in the midsection, and the shaggy veteran exhaled a ", " of air. Blair backpedaled, then crouched, reaching out again with his improvised weapon, and got the rim of the seat past Waren's ankle, at which point he pulled the stool back towards him.

", "This first chapter reads a lot like the giver, I like the voicing and the setting is a welcome change of pace from most dystopian novels, but I can't help getting pangs of nostalgia which run too deep, as if there is a confluence of repeated ideas here which are just being aligned in this way and aren't really particularly original. If I could ask, could you please provide a sort of introduction (like a brief summary not including twists and spoilers obviously) to the novel to acquaint ourselves with the characters a little better? The first chapter fleshed out a lot of the setting and provides several important points concerning the behavior and nature of our narrator, but I can't glean much about what their (the narrators I mean) relation to anyone independently is (quite obviously the conflict is the lack of food/supplies and the arrival at whatever their \"destination\" is, but that could mean a lot of things, and what the reuniting and rebooting of the ship means). To me, a work like this (tried and true dystopian/post apocalypse) is made or broken based on the writing of the narrator and their interactions. For instance, if the narrator here is a 19 year old whose family has died and has a small band of friends who he gets into crazy sci-fi adventures with on this ship from hell I would totally dig it, but if the narrator is some little pansy, and the story centers around the conflict within the family and within the tribe and our narrator is passive than I would be less interested in it. This obviously is my own bias as there are many great stories with both active and more passive or subdued narrators, but I find it hard to gauge what kind of person our narrator is from the brief chapter 1, other than they are a passenger on this ship/they are observant (implied intelligence)/ interested in the history of the ship and assumably of earth.

He excelled in battle. He excelled in everything, but combat was the one area in which he did not consistently procrastinate. It suited him, and so did his career. Epikrates did not want to sit alone and paint, or solve complex equations. He wanted to experience new things, meet people, travel to new and exciting places. Killing was an unfortunate requirement of his position, but he would rather have blood stains on his soul than live a life of boredom.", "The sky was beginning to turn gray, and there was now a distinct circular path carved into the leaves.

He absent-mindedly rubbed it with his thumb. It drew blood, causing Epikrates to twist his foot in surprise. This made a very loud rustling sound in the dry leaves he was standing on. What trick of the gods was this, to turn a sharp blade dull for a moment just as it struck him? ", "The leaves rustled once more as the messenger crept over dry leaves around the tree. Epikrates began silently climbing the large trunk. When he reached the height of two men, he looked down to see a shadowy figure carrying a bronze sword, glinting pale gold in the morning light.

She was beautiful. Her hand gently touched his, still holding the arrow to her heart, and she stopped smiling. The clouds parted suddenly to reveal the most glorious sunrise ever to be completely ignored, and a ray of light illuminated her eyes through the trees on the edge of the forest. Her pupils dilated. Their lips pressed together as Epikrates pressed the tip of the arrow against her skin, and ripped her tunic from the bosom down to the waist, where the shaft of the arrow broke. She laughed and took his knife from its sheathe, then thrust it into his chest, creating a slit into which she inserted both hands.

Fuzzy specks of light filled my line of vision. Behind the specks, an upside down head and a long whip of blond hair appeared from above.\n\u201cDamn, Lorney. If you wanted your head in my ass all you had to do was ask.\u201d Katie slide gracefully from the top bunk and landed on her feet like the feline predator she thought of herself as being. I envied her poise but in exchange she, in all of her 5 feet and 2 inches envied my ability to reach the weapons on the top shelves without needing a box to stand on. I flipped her off with one hand while rubbing my head with the other. Everyone in the barracks jumped out of bed and started throwing on their gear. Ever since the Greater Depression caused a civil war in the continental United States, the country had devolved into 40 or so warring factions. Every state for themselves. People still talked about the \u201cUnited States\u201d but there was nothing united about them. I always had dreams of one day leaving Birmingham for a bigger city. New York City or Chicago. Somewhere not in the shadows of the Appalachian Mountains. Somewhere not in the South. Somewhere not so goddamn hot all the time. Now I\u2019m trapped here for the foreseeable future. After the war started, I was drafted into the Sovereignty of Alabama\u2019s militia. I\u2019m forced to risk my life protecting a land that I don't want to be in. Our commander started issuing instructions over the loudspeakers. \u201cATTENTION. Floridean forces detected. All personal report to the southern barricades and initiate defensive procedures.\u201d Our commander, an artificial intelligence program codenamed \u201cDixie\u201d drawled on in her robotic voice. Who knew a computer program could have a Southern accent? Her announcement began playing on a loop but was drowned out by the sound of soldiers gathering their weapons and running towards the door. \u201cLorney, get your ass in gear. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, everyone else\u2019s asses are all in gear. Even Charleston\u2019s ass is in gear and his left ass cheek got stabbed by a rogue from Atlanta last week.\u201d Katie\u2019s favorite word was \u201cass\u201d and sprinkled her speech with it like a fine seasoning. With the country falling apart and everything going to hell, her tough, fuck-with-me-I-dare-you attitude gets her through it all. She\u2019s a huge pain in my ass and I wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without her. She is also one of the few people I know that never took the HB Vaccine, the vaccine that ruined everything for everyone. 4 years ago, a group of jilted researchers who specialized in both neuropsychiatric sociology and occult rituals stumbled upon scientific evidence confirming the existence of soulmates. Building on their discovery, they were able to create a vaccine with the purpose of preventing heartbreak and bad relationships. An unintended side effect was that it also protected against physical hurt in addition to emotional pain. It was a miracle combination of science and the supernatural. The only caveat being that the vaccine was only effective against your one true soulmate. The world welcomed the medicine into its veins without any doubt or hesitation. Heartbreak always seemed like an inevitable part of the human condition, and humanity was primed to obliterate it. However, the dating rituals changed rapidly once the vaccinations started. Instead of dances, high schools began hosting fight clubs. Punch someone in the face and if it doesn\u2019t hurt them, you\u2019ve found your soulmate. Random people began attacking each other in streets, trying to find the person they were meant to be with. People stopped using dating websites and lost interest in online social networks. In 2044, Facebook became the official sponsor of the state of California, but when the company went under 10 years later, so did the state. Everyone underestimates the economic power of the lonely. Getting my ass in gear, as Katie politely requested I do, I threw on my weapons belt, chewed some standard-issue amphetamines from the bucket that was being passed around, and made my way outside. \u201cIt good and goddamn figures those asshole Florida Disneyland dickheads would come at us at the crack of ass when I was gonna have my first full night of sleep in a week.\u201d Katie bitched as she put on her helmet and leather jacket. The Sovereignty of Alabama didn\u2019t provide its soldiers with much in the way of protective gear, so a lot of us had to make do with what we could find. In her free time, Katie had embossed the back of her jacket with \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO READ THIS, THEN YOUR ASS IS GRASS.\u201d and the S. of A.\u2019s seal, except she drew over the image of the Vulcan statue with a Sharpie and made him into the Grim Reaper. We approached the southern barricade right as the sun started glowing over the horizon. We took our stations. Everything was still and almost quiet. Nothing but the sounds of cicadas and birds and the faint echo of Dixie about a mile back calling an empty barracks to attention. Minutes passed. I watched the guards in the towersas their eyes darted around looking for the first signs of whatever slime the Florida Republic scooped from the wetlands and sent to raid our camp. The FR forces were always trying to get into our camp but could never make it past the barricade. More time passed by. We were getting bored and restless. Some of the soldiers wandered off in search of a private place to take their morning piss. Some were vaping e-cigs and some were just sitting on the ground, staring into space. Suddenly, the guards started clambering down off the towers while shouting. \u201cEVERYONE GET BACK! THEY\u2019VE GOT A FUCKING MISSILE LAUNCHER!

I wave the staff in front of me and turn invisible, running down the trench. Running always running. Once I finally drop the spell out of the range of the artillery bombardment I drop to my knees and rest. I dig the staff into the ground and lay the rifle against it. This unholy war would be the death of my I was sure. Thats when I saw something jump over the wall and towards me", "She came out of no where and I felt an arm come flying with the rest of her and sock me right in the jaw, knocking us both to the ground. She's got a staff of her own and a pistol at her side, pointing the former's blade at my chest trying to drive it into my chest. Clutching it around the joining piece of the wood and metal, i see it slowly slip further and further towards my vital organs. I kick up and send her over my head and scramble for my own staff only to come to my feet staring down the barrel of her pistol. \n", " I lower my blade but still keep my muscles tense bcz I know what's coming next\n\"I'm sorry.\" ", " hammer striking metal and exploding a small ball of lead forward into my skull... except there is no bang... a misfire!", "I spin flicking my wrist and send the weapon flying engaging in melee with one another.

A lightning bolt shoots from her blue crystal before her legs push her into the air towards me blade once again searching for my flesh. I dodge the crackling blue energy before parrying the attack into the ground on my left. Vines come and hold it still before I swing low again attempting to take her feet out from under her. Instead I come in contact with her now imbedded staff and the resulting release of energy sent us both flying across the battle arena and into a wall (her) and a wooden table/chair set near by (me) our weapons no where in sight. ", "When I wake up, I look around and feel a heat surrounding me. The table and chairs are now ash. The wood holding up what was once a trench is now gone and most of the trench itself having flowed its example. The water in the mud had all but evaporated and what sand and dirt remained was glowing a hot red. I looked around for my adversary, wondering how I survived such an intense explosion and then how had either of us survived?? She was doing something quite similar to me from the other side of the newly formed crater... No... it couldn't be. Not her. Not now. Why did it have to be here?!", "We both seem to come to the same realization, scream, and get up and charge each other making contact in the center of the barren circle", "Edit I meant war not way", "The light of the moon filtered through the tops of the trees, the thin forest surrounding me in my foxhole silent. My breathe came short and quick and my heart was pounding in my throat, though I still couldn't hear. I knew after the shelling came the men and the fear kept me jumping at shadows. Maybe these shadows were my minds creation, the unrelenting pounding of artillery had kept me up for the last two nights, but I had to keep jumping in case one of them turned out real. The only smell was the decay of my comrade, his right eye blasted out by a piece of shrapnel in the last barrage. I didn't have time to move him out and I wasn't sure I would have the opportunity to apologize to his mother for letting her son die.", "It took an eternity of minutes for the dark figures to begin moving through trees ahead and at the sight of them I panicked. I curled into a ball at first and covered my head with my hands, living in a world of blood rushing and hyperventilation. Some part of me, probably the part the army drilled into me, took over and mechanically pulled the corpse over myself. I began to play dead because I knew I would die if I didn't.", "The gunfire started very nearly after, the cracks breaking the painted scene of the night. It began to sound more like the fourth of July than any other firefight I had been in, maybe cause it lacked the explosions amd visceral visuals that normally accompanied. I would wager it took around ten minutes for the gunfire to peter out, but it is hard to tell when hiding like I was. I did my best to stay still and calm my breath, but my lungs begged for air and I had no choice but to acquiesce, though in an attempt to stay hidden I moved the body above my nearer to my face so maybe the steam wouldn't be noticeable.  The sound of crunching snow all around told me that people were passing by, almost certainly the enemy, but beyond several comments I couldn't understand, I had no interaction with these men.", "I waited, more patient than my mother ever was with me or my brothers, until I didn't hear anymore feet passing by and then waited some more. I became certain that they had all passed, convinced myself of it, and finally pulled the body off of my chest and pushed it to the side, thanking him as I did.  I crawled to the edge of the hole and peered above the snow, desperately searching for any enemy. I suppose I should have looked behind, towards where they went instead of where they came from, and I certainly shouldn't have just stood up, but as quickly as I stood, I heard a shout from behind me. I turned to see a man in one of the despised uniforms leveling his rifle at me. I fell on my ass, mind blank in the panic, but recovered as my enemies rifle jammed. Strange, but I didn't think much about it as I tried to chamber out of the hole. It didn't take long to get out, but it gave the adversary enough time to pull out his knife and near me. He lunged at my throat, certain to kill, and I said my apologies to my family and my god that I went out this way.  ", "We fell backwards into the foxhole and for a moment I was dead. Not truly, but convinced enough of my doom that I just lay back in the snowy den, eyes closed and refusing to breath. When I heard an exclaim of what was supposedly surprise, confusion entered and I cracked open my eyes. I was most definitely not dead and the man who straddled me, knife in hand, looked as confused as I felt. He attempted another plunge of the blade, but it just bounced off a bit, then continued along my side into the ground. ", "We both understood what was happening, but the disbelief of such a coincidence showed on his face as much as it must have shown on mine.  I had always denied this side of myself, not wanting to disappoint my mother who desperately wanted grandchildren, but the blatant truth of the matter forced itself upon me. My soul mate slowly stood and he walked away towards the other end of the hole, but I continued to lay in the snow, exhaustion overcoming the shock and confusion. I didn't want to continue, I just wanted to lay there and let the snow cover me,but the same instinct that pulled the corpse over me pushed me off the ground. ", "I chambered to my feet and turned to the man who was my match, the man who was exactly perfect for me, who would make me the most happy and I would make him the most happy. The Bible said that soul mates were just two halves of a single angel that found each other, but I didn't feel the happiness that should have accompanied the moment, the joy all the stories spoke of. My other half turned to face me and he started to say something in his native tongue, but I only knew its slurs so I understood nothing. He figured this out quickly and began to speak my language, broken but understandable.  He asked for my surrender, told me he would take me in and after the war we could live in peace.  I wanted the same, I knew I wanted it, but want does not a soldier make. I moved towards him and lightly kissed him, shocking him but he surprisingly didn't resist. Maybe it shouldn't have surprised me, but it did. I embraced him tightly for a moment, breathing him in more calmly than I should, and pulled away. As I pulled away, I lifted the pin from the grenade strapped on his chest. It took him a moment too long to realize I had, and the sadness in his eyes made me regret just a bit, but the duty of the soldier and the patriot held fast in my mind in my last moments.", "The first time I saw her was when I was 5, it was the big activity hall a few miles away, my parents took me and some of my classmates there occasionally if we got too messy in the house. I was running around with a foam sword, chasing Michael when I saw her, she was at the art table, I stopped for a moment but paid her no mind, I had no interest in girls after all, but she had this green paint smudged across her face in the cutest way. I ran after Michael, she turned from the table and ran towards me, scissors in hand after more craft paper. We crashed. Her mother came rushing over screaming \"Lila! What have I told you about running with scissors!\" she grabbed me, to see if I was hurt but there was nothing, the scissors had crumpled against my skin and her mothers face changed, she seemed happy, but shocked, I didn't understand, I pulled away and ran off into the sea of giggling children, thinking I would get in trouble. I didn't see either of them the rest of the day but her name still rang in my head. Lila. ", "Years passed and I never told anyone about the incident, I didn't think it mattered, people would talk about soul mates and love and she'd always be there in the back of my mind but I guess it never really clicked. I saw her again when I was 17, I was late, she was late, we crashed, again, in the middle of the street, knocking us both over. We didn't even spare a glance, I just gathered my dropped papers, mumbled a sorry and ran off, she did the same. It didn't even register until I got to class and looked at my papers. There amidst the pile was one I didn't recognise. The neatly scribbled handwriting, the faint smell of coffee, and there in the corner, a smudge of purple paint, it seemed to just be a shopping list but I held onto it, I carefully packed it into my wallet and went about my day in autopilot, still thinking about her and the more I did, the more it made sense. There was not a single scratch, bump, or bruise on me from the impact and though it was only a moment, I can still see her breathtakingly grey eyes and the hint of blue that danced around them. Michael mentioned that I had seemed unfocused that day but I brushed it off saying that I was tired, he left me to it and gave me a copy of his biology notes after class. ", "More years passed and I didn't see her, I joined the army along with some other classmates, I'd never been great academically, so it was that or office work and I'm not one to sit still. Our country fell into war with itself and the surrounding areas and I've honestly never felt more in my element. I was in my prime, leading my own team, doing what I loved. My squad along with a few others were to storm a town a few over from my own, it had been evacuated of innocents a few months ago and now only rebels remained. We split off, checking out each house as we went. We got to a small house on the 5th street, me and another went in to check it out while the rest of the groups did other houses. I cautiously made my way up the stairs while my buddy swept downstairs, everything was clear until I made my way towards the back room. As I entered I saw it. The smallest movement behind a bed, but I saw it. I slowly drew my combat knife and lunged at the same moment that they jumped at me, they were armed with nothing but a pen. We fell to the ground, both swinging our weapons, I swung for her stomach as the pen made contact with my eye. I lay there horrified at the lack of pain, I looked to my knife, only to see it crumpled in my hand, she raised her arm for another attack but hesitated, echoing my horror. There she was. 12 years since the last incident. The shopping list, ", " shopping list, still sitting in my breast pocket. Lila. She trembled slightly and the beginnings of a laugh escaped her thin, blood-soaked lips. In that fraction of a moment there was nothing else but us, I studied every detail of her heart shaped face and lost myself for what seemed like eons in her stormy eyes. Then it was over. ", "Michael had stormed into the room, seeing the bedraggled rebel on top of me, arm still raised. Without a second thought he shot her. Perfectly between the eyes, as he had been trained to do. I watched in slow motion as her skull caved in on itself and her delicate body slumped onto me. He shoved her off and pulled me up but I couldn't see him. I couldn't hear him yelling, asking if I was hurt, I couldn't feel him shaking me to snap me out of it. He had shot her. He was protecting me, but he had killed her, my soulmate. Lila. I couldn't blame him. He couldn't have known. He wouldn't have known. He was defending me. His best friend of over 25 years. But I could not look at him. I stared at her body on the floor and shot him. My squad had heard then gunfire and now entered the room, seeing the two bodies on the floor and me, gun in hand, covered in blood. I ordered them to continue the search. Leave me here. For a while they refused. I waved the gun in their faces and they eventually left. I crumpled to the floor. ", "I sat there holding her body for hours, days, weeks maybe, I had no concept of time, I could see the light of the moon or sun streaming through the window in an endless cycle as I sat there with her. My Lila. Nobody came back for me. I didn't expect them to. After waiting so long it finally happened, a loud noise and a flash of light. They had dropped the bomb as ordered, eviscerating the remainder of the rebel town. I held her decaying body close as it took me. I don't believe in an after life, but I hope I will find her again.

I did not know how he had managed to fight his way inside the small command hut in the trenches, but considering his skill in the art of killing, it did not seem that odd for him to have managed to do so with nothing but his detached bayonet. The man had probably carved his path through people I consider my comrades, but in this moment I held no contempt for the man, what I felt was pity. A man driven insane from this craziness, or maybe he was this crazy to begin with and that's why they let him loose on us in the first place. In any case, I also felt quite saddened from the fact that apparently, this man was my soulmate. He did not speak my language, nor do I believe he had any motivation to listen to me even if he did. I pondered the situation for a moment, and a small internal laugh occurred to me as I realized how absurd the universe is for assigning such a person as my soulmate, but I'd try to make best of the situation. He was my soulmate and I would try to somehow reason with him. I reached down my pocket and offered the man my christmas chocolate, perhaps that would signal that I was a friendly. I could see the man's eyes light up in a different ways, calmness washing over his troubled face. He rubbed off some of the dried blood and mud off his face and slowly raised his open hand to take some chocolate.

I stared at him for a few seconds and said \"yeah, nobody cares, go back to fighting\".  And then as all british people do, I took a cup and filled it with tea from my personal stash I carry around always. I took a sip of my special tea, and my mouth was filled with its delicious goodness, and then I walked out of the former cabin and regrouped with the rest of my comrades.

She dropped the revolver, and had sprinted half the distance between us before it hit the ground.  I brought the rifle to bear, but as the stock settled into the familiar notch in my shoulder, the entire body gave a sudden twist, dislodging my grip, and clattered to the ground.  She was upon me now, having pulled some type of knife from a kit at the small of her back.  She channeled her momentum into a powerful thrust at my neck.  I swatted her wrist off target and grabbed her around the waist, turning my hips and countering her attack with a throw.  She went with it, tucking her head and landing on her feet.  We twisted and turned in towards each other, each striking and countering with practiced ease.  Each time I was sure a blow would land, I would only hit air, and likewise, she would throw these amazingly placed slashes that would glance off my armor.  Neither of us gave an inch of ground.  It was then that I noticed her knife.  The curved shape and rear-facing barbs seemed so familiar.  Ah, a Vassluon de-vester, carried by field medics to remove the armor of heavy units by severing the fibers that held the plates in place.  It was a versatile tool, though I'd never seen anyone use it like this.  She had four red stripes on the inside of her right bicep, indicating a high rank in some Vasslu martial art.  That explained it.  But even as I made the observation, the reason she would use such a weapon dawned on me far too late.  With one more cut beneath my armpit, the plate protecting my torso fell from its place, leaving me exposed.  Without the guarantee of safety from her small blade, the tide of the fight quickly shifted into her favor.  Counter, counter, make space, get close, avoid, dodge, back up.  My mind was on autopilot, what little cognitive function I had trying to find a way out of this encounter in which I was heavily outmatched.  She stepped between my legs, behind my heel, dropped into a crouch, and rammed her small shoulder into me with enough force to knock me off balance.  Briefly, I saw her framed in the light above us, shining through the big ass hole I had fallen through.  She was an avenging angel, a Seraphim from the Seat of the Thirteen Stars, sent to take my debt of flesh for all those I had wronged.  With a guttural cry of victory that lives in the throats of all predators, she leaped, coming down dagger first.  She was aiming for my heart.  Then the worst thing that could have possibly happened at that moment did.  She hit her mark.  And instead of ending me, a white light, brighter than even the golden rays behind her, bloomed from the point between us, stopping it.  Her hips crashed down onto mine, and we both stared at our light, comprehending, but not believing.", "When the Thirteen created man and woman, they saw that they would often wander apart, into the darkness where the primordial fears sat in wait.  Terror would shortly overcome them, and after a time, they would lash out at and kill anything that touched them, even those of their own kind.  Even the ones they loved the most.  To the Thirteen, the solution was simple.  In our times of greatest fear and trepidation, when we lose ourselves to terror, or anger, or sorrow, there will always be a light at the bottom to comfort us.  All we had to do was find our other halves.  Complete the circuit, and find relief.  The gods' most visible gift.", "We stared at our light, comprehending, but not believing.  Her pretty eyes met my one good one.  She rose, the very picture of grace, and the light faded.  She gestured around the room, which to this point I had not gotten a good look at, and for the first time, I saw cots.  Women and children stared back at me with undisguised apprehension.  This wasn't a Vasslu military training complex, it was a secret clinic, helping those displaced by our nations' war.  I looked back up at her.  She was breathing as heavily as I was.  She must have been a defector from the Vasslu special forces.  Now I could see the desperation and worry in her eyes more clearly.  There was a heavy pause as she bent down to examine the insignias on my discarded breastplate.  Kendragi scout, 50th company.   After another moment, she helped me up, and pointed to an unoccupied cot.  I sat myself down, and she pulled up a stool beside me and set to work on my eye.  The other one was busy staring at her.  \"I'm Vlak,\" says I, nervous as a schoolboy talking to his first crush.  She stares at me for a long second, then smiles.  \"Lylai.\"", "Three days into battle, my gear was half cover in blood from my enemies and friend from my unit. Only 12 out of 50 had survived the carnage, we regroup with survivor from the west unit and the medical response team that came looking to treat the ones that were left. In total we were about 60, all hidden in a cave form by a rock climbing from the underground on the valley at the beginning of the forest. This giant rock gave us shelter that night, no fire was lit, no food was cooked as nobody was hungry nor cold. It was just an share sense of shock and disbelief that we were all hiding in a cave that could be comfortable if we were only 20 or 15. There was barely room to move without touching anyone else. \nThe next morning, before the light of the day could completely dissipate the dark, while the world was in a gray state, I hear the horror in the voice of the medic running back to the cave, \"they found us!\" He was screaming while an arrow pierce his skull from the back to the middle of his forehead. Nobody was ready, the blades were on the side of the ones still sleeping and bows and knifes out of reach for the ones that were awake. About 45 of our enemies were in front of us and that giant rock that gave us shelter was now a tombstone for all of us. I went a reach for a flat piece of wood that had a branch to hold to it as a shield, took a blade that wasn't mine to get ready for battle. That's when I felt it, a knife flying straight into my eye, I covered my face with the wood, dropped the blade and went to instinctively pull the knife out, there was no pain, there was no blood. Confuse I grabbed my blade again, another 2 knife were already in the wood and by the time I saw past it she was already in front of my with sword in hand delivering blows to my shield, her yellow eyes were burning like fire as she was trying to unsuccessfully trying to split my head. I thought she did but nothing happened, she didn't kill me. Her face changed from rage to gracefully look m, she looked disturbed but at the same time happy in way that could hardly be seen but I felt it, I felt it too.\nIt was too quick, i saw it after I happened. Her bright yellow eyes started dim and close as some blood started to drip from her brown hair.

STOP DESTROYING MY WORKSHOP!\"", "\"What? You said \"Destroy\". You never said ", " to destroy after signing the contract.\" I shrugged and carried on laying ruin to what I'm guessing is this mans livelihood.", "Salthazar sulked and slumped into a corner, \"Now I see why they told me never to trust Demons...\"", "I swear this happened exactly as I'm saying, but there's no way I'll put my name on it.  They'd lock me in the looney bin forever.", "I was just sitting on the sofa, watching TV, and then I was sitting in a room with no chair and fell on my butt.  My back was against something - well, not something, more nothing, but nothing that felt like something.  Like a forcefield I guess.  There were markings on the floor that lined up, and some candles nearby.", "And there was some sort of odd alien looking up from a book and saying \"Ah, and now you are summoned!  I have bound you to my will!\"  So I said \"What for?\"", "He, I guess it was a he, said \"To exact revenge on my enemies!\"  He shuffled through some pictures and showed me one.  \"Kill him!\"  I said \"Murder is immoral, I don't know who that is, I seem to be stuck in a forcefield, and I wouldn't know how to kill one of you guys anyway.  Do you even have hearts?\"", "The alien seemed confused for a moment.  \"You can't smite my enemies?\"  I said \"I don't even know what 'smite' means, but it sounds kind of rude.  Speaking of which, why am I stuck in this forcefield?  That seems rude too.\"", "Now he was angry.  \"What kind of demon are you?!  I summoned a demon from Hell, I want some action!

Does that sound to you like someone with wealth and power?\"", "He looked even more confused.  \"The devil's name is Tim Horton?\"", "I said \"Somehow I don't think so.  I'm not even sure Tim Horton is a real person; maybe it's like Aunt Jemima.\"", "\"Demons have aunts?\"", "\"Why do you keep saying I'm a demon?\"", "\"Because I used a demon summoning spell!  Don't you come from a place of misery ruled by an evil being?\"", "\"Well, that's maybe overstating it a little, but I guess you're not too far off.\"", "\"So you should have some kind of special powers that don't exist on my world!\"", "\"Well, okay, but I don't know what powers exist on your world, so how am I supposed to know what's considered special?\"", "\"Don't you know anything?!\"", "\"I know lots of stuff.

Do you know how to juggle?\"", "\"No, but I don't want that.  I want something that will let me wreak vengeance on those who have wronged me!\"", "\"How about flying?  Can you fly?\"", "\"Fly?  Flying?!  Yes, that one.  If I could fly, I do all kinds of things!\"", "\"Well, okay, let's do that.  I'll focus on you, and you go open the window.\"", "He walked over to the window, and turned a crank to open it up.  \"Okay,\" he said, \"I've got it open.  Now what?\"", "I said, \"Stand on the ledge, and picture yourself flying, and jump into the air.\"", "He did.  And did not so much fly as plummet.", "A few hours later, some sort of uniformed people came into the room.  One screamed.  A guy (I guess it was a guy) who looked like a cleric looked at me and said \"This demon drove him to jump to his death!\"  I said \"He said he wanted to murder people.  He demanded I help him commit a murder.  There was only one person here I had the power to kill, and I was required to obey.\"", "The cleric said \"Back to Hell with you!\" and blew out the candles.  Which was fine with me.  At least here we have Tim Horton's.", "\"Look man, I don't think you know what you're doing. There's gonna be some serious repercussions for this kind of shit,\" Tom said as he leaned back in his chair, glowering at a sweaty, porcine man across the table from him.", "\"I've got to fucking do it, Tom,\" Greg whimpered out, his lower lip quivering ever so slightly. He held out a closed fist, opened it, and a handful of dice scattered across the table. It was almost like a movie, eyes all fixated on the d20 as it clattered to a stop. A natural 20. The crowd went wild and Tom launched out of his chair, hands pressed to his temples in a gesture of supreme existential horror. Once the din of the table died down, Tom finally unfroze from his statuesque position and slumped back into his chair.", "\"... No.\" Greg's face scrunched up into a pout.", "\"C'mon man, it was a natural 20! I seduced the Lich!\"", "\"No, dude. I'm sick of you constantly fucking up my plans with your bullshit amazing luck. I would rather DIE than see you do what you're doing.\"", "Just as Greg was about to retort, a crack of lightning shook the room around them and Tom exploded in a gout of black smoke. As the rest of the table did a quick check of the contents of their britches, Greg stammered out the one thing he could think to say: \"Did he just straight up fucking explode?!\"", "Unfortunately for Tom, he did not in fact \"straight up fucking explode.\" The next thing he knew, he was falling flat on his ass against a hard stone floor. If Tom, let alone any human being ever, had actually been subject to a demon summoning ritual as he just had, he would know the typical signs and symptoms: candles, maybe a candelabra if his host was fancy, salt circles, and some adorable little munchkin-type people in robes who had just summoned a hellbeast of unimaginable power. As one could expect, Tom was reasonably alarmed and upset. He scrambled back against the wall, knocking over many a tiny chair and smashing a table or two with accidental ease.", "\"What the fuck just happened?!\" The summoners, witnessing the wrath of a dark lord, began to scream. Only one of them did not panic. The short little wrinkled creature gazed solemnly upon him, an open book cradled in one hand. Tom's mouth went slack and eyes wide when he truly perceived the creature's face.", "\"Oh my god... you've got an adorable little pug face!\" he practically squealed. While Tom immediately regretted his reaction, it was no less true. Every single one of them was an adorable little bipedal pug person. In a little hooded robe. One of them even has a cute little walking stick!", "\"Thomas Kinsey!\" the tiny creature belted out in a somewhat squeaky voice, pointing at a bewildered Tom. \"By your true name, I bind you to my will!\"", "\"I... I'm sorry, what?\" Tom inquired, squinting incredulously. \"Bind me? Like I'm some kind of demon or something?\" All those years of D&D were finally paying dividends. This seemed to throw the wee sage off balance, now wide-eyed and flipping through the book as quickly as he could, one of his compatriots clinging to his arm and babbling nigh incomprehensibly.", "\"I told you we shouldn't have mettled with the dark arts! He's going to fry us in sulfur pits and strip the meat from our bones!\" Tom couldn't help but look fairly disgusted.", "\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you on about? I don't even know why I'm here. Or where here even is. Who ARE you?\"", "The leader of this ragamuffin group stepped forward, looking wary but less terrified of their guest at this point.", "\"I am Gynklef, my Lord,\" he said with a proper bow. \"We have summoned you here to strike a dark bargain, if you would hear our terms.\" Tom, once again, glanced at the figure incredulously. This has got to be a dream. Or a stroke. It can't be reality, at the very least.", "\"... oooookay. Uh... what are your terms?\" He crossed his arms over his chest, still fairly unsure of what was actually happening. Maybe he was dead and this was some crazy little fantasy in his head as the last of his neurons sputtered out. An aneurysm would make sense.", "\"We bring you precious stones and gems to curry favor, in hopes that you will help my people overthrow the cruel oppressors that so long ago usurped the throne from my father's father...\" With a gesture, one of the other pug-monks pushed a battered chest up to the periphery of the circle and opened it, revealing a pile of gold nuggets and raw, uncut gems.", "\"We know your kind has a penchant for that which shines and lies within the earth. It is yours, if you will help us.\" Tom stood agog, staring at the chest. He'd be set for life if he could take that back with him. There was an emerald as big as his fist just sitting there! He shook himself from his stupor and sighed.", "\"I mean... what can I do? I'm just one guy,\" he muttered, scuffing the heel of a shoe against the grimy stone floor.", "\"Perhaps... but one of your kind is required to operate... THE ARTIFACT.\" Hushed whispers among the congregation could be heard. Tom arched a single brow.", "\"The artifact? What is it?\"", "\"An item of incredible power... it has brought down kingdoms before, broken the wills of those who would seek to stand against it, and brought terror to those who even hear its name.\" The tiny figure gestured to one of his compatriots. ", "\"Bring it here, quickly!\"", "After a lengthy pause, the sound of wagon wheels could be heard against the floor, and through the door entered what almost appeared to be an upright and ornately decorated coffin on wheels. Grynklef drew an ancient looking key, inset with bone, and released the locks.", "\"Behold! Terrorscream, Render of Kingdoms!\" he bellowed (as well as someone with his lung capacity could) as he flung the door open, revealing...", "\"... a fucking vacuum,\" Tom stated flatly. Grynklef nodded solemnly.", "\"It is a weapon we do not use lightly, but... times are desperate. More of my people die by the day.\" Tom nodded solemnly for a moment, and stepped from the circle, brushing a hand across the handle of this vacuum that looked like it belonged in the Warhammer universe.", "\"Okay, little dog dudes... let's topple a kingdom.\"", "The room's runes glowed with such warding powers that the candles only served the purpose of spell ingredients.  I paused the game, I was already at a pay point anyway having died multiple times because I needed the sword of Amecles to kill Hexigron and $3.99 was not in today's budget.  ", "I made a step backwards in shock only to be thrown forward, a second bump on my forehead threw me back. I noticed the chaos symbol on the ceiling, it was surrounded by two vipers swallowing each others tails to make a circle.

Even they knew what she held.  ", "My mouth hung open. I could feel the essence calling me, pleading it needed to be back home. She flung it to the floor and as it shattered it made it's way to me.

I've gotten lightheaded before but never just passed out. Then a bright light turned on, shining in my face. When I grew adjusted to the light I realized that I was no longer walking outside. My mouth hung open as I tried to take everything in. My cigarette fell to the floor.", "The room looked like it was made out of rainbows. There were creatures standing around me wearing black hooded robes. One of them was reading out of a book. It kind of looked like a bible. The creatures looked kinda like humans, but they had wings.", "\"Are you guys... angels?\" I finally eked out.", "They laughed. \"Just because you are a demon does not mean we are angels.\"", "\"I'm not a demon!\" I yelled. They recoiled. One of them whimpered. My brain started to process where I was. I was standing in the middle of a pentagram. There were candles at the points and someone had carefully laid out a ring of salt. Maybe I am a demon.", "First things first, I had to check if I was a demon. I reached up to my head. No horns. Okay. Next, try to walk over the salt. It worked, but the creatures screamed. One of them fled the room. They were afraid of me.", "Then it hit me. If I'm a demon then I've been living in hell. It felt like hell, but I never actually thought that it was hell. Being poor just seemed like a thing that poor people had to deal with. Wait a second... Demons make deals! I don't have to be poor anymore!", "I tried to put on my fiercest and most serious face. \"What do you want?\" I boomed. \"And what do you offer me?\" I had seen enough Supernatural to know how these go down.", "One creature, the one hiding behind his book, stepped forward and started to speak. \"We want to make a deal with you. I'm willing to give you my soul if you can make this man suffer.\" He pulled out a photo of another angel looking guy.", "I tried (poorly) to stifle a chuckle. \"I don't want your soul.\"", "\"My first born then?\"", "\"No. Just give me some money and I'll do what you ask.\"", "\"Money? What does a demon want with money?\" He asked his question with a quizzical look.", "\"You don't question my demands and I won't question yours.\" That seemed to appease him.", "They pulled out a bag of gold coins. Their ridiculously archaic knowledge of demons was top notch. \"Is this enough?\" He asked as he opened the bag in my direction. It was more money than I'd ever had in my bank account. I merely nodded, barely keeping together my \"serious\" composure.", "I took the bag from him with the photo. There was a name scribbled on the top. That was enough to get my job started. Once again with the booming voice I said, \"It will be done.\" I picked up my lit cigarette, put it back in my mouth, and left the room and the house that room happened to be in. While walking down the street the gold in my bag clinked and hearing it made me smile.

Fuck, this retail stocking shit is not fun. Time for a break. He walked over to the door, reached in his shirt pocket and grabbed for his smokes. Opening the door, he stepped through into brilliant sunlight.", "What the fuck? This is night shift. He blinked and held his hand to his brow to shade his eyes.", "In an instant he could see that he was not in the back parking lot of the Northland Mall. He was standing on a giant slab of stone, and the smell of salt was in the air. He turned to where the door he had just passed through should have been and there was met with the gaze of a fat nude woman with red hair.", "Jason squared up towards her and looked her over. What. The. Fuck. A wave of panic washed over him, and the woman began to move to his left chanting in a language that he did not understand while moving her fleshy arms in circles. That's when he noticed the others in the darkness.", "Behind the fat woman was a crowd. Several dozen people. There were men and women, all dressed in shabby clothing that was dirty. Jason noticed one woman near the front holding an infant in her arms. She stared directly at him, her eyes cold and flat. It was then that Jason noticed the baby's limb dangling limply and he knew that something was not right.", "The redheaded woman continued to circle Jason, her gesticulations becoming wilder and her voice rising. Jason shouted back to her. Fuck you! What the fuck is this!? He tried to approach her and his legs felt like iron. Each step felt as if he was pulling a tree's roots from the earth, and when it fell flat against the stone he felt a stabbing pain radiate upward through his leg.", "What is this? He shouted again. Just then a man stepped forth from the crowd. He pointed at the redheaded woman and yelled. He pointed at Jason and then back to the crowd, all the time speaking a strange tongue Jason had never encountered before.", "The woman stood looking at Jason, and extended her palm toward him. She stared at Jason, and then turned to speak to the man, keeping her hand directed towards Jason. Jason looked from one to the other, and began to feel his knees buckle. His head was growing light, and he was feeling wobbly. What now?", "Falling to his knees, he put his hands down and the stone felt like fire against his flesh. He yelled out in anguish. The man's voice rose, and several others stepped forward from the crowd behind him, all facing the redheaded woman. One man was carrying a child, obviously dead, it's lifeless corpse held tenderly in his arms. He pointed a finger at the nude woman, and then towards Jason.", "The redheaded woman stared intently at Jason. He attempted to lift his hands to crawl, but it felt like his hands had become part of the stone, like he was being pulled into it. What is this? What is happening? He looked all around him and saw that the crowd was in a circle around him and they were moving towards the woman, who kept her gaze on Jason. She began to speak, and turned her head toward the advancing mob. Three people in the front of the line dropped to the turf, dead in their tracks. She kept her hand pointed toward Jason, and began to motion with the other above her head.", "A light formed over Jason, and he looked up to meet it. Suddenly it felt like rain falling on his face, and the brilliance overwhelmed him.", "\"Jason, hey Jason ...\" The voice was familiar. It was Stan. \"Hey man, you OK?\"", "Jason blinked and looked up. Stan, the heavyset night security guard was standing on his hoverround with his flashlight on Jason's eyes. \"What ... where ...\"", "\"Dude, are you OK?\"", "Jason felt the cool pavement beneath his hand and clamored to his feet. His knees felt uneasy. His head throbbed, and on the ground in front of him was a cigarette. \"Yeah, I, uh, I don't know what happened ...\"", "\"OK, bro, I don't know what you're smoking and I don't really care, but just be careful out here. I heard some dudes from West Haven jumped a guy last week.\" Stan looked him over once more before turning around on the hoverround and zipping across the parking lot.", "Jason watched him, Stan's red pony tail poking out from underneath his black baseball cap. Man, fuck night shift.", "\"Shit shit shit\" I said under my breath as I raced down the sidewalk towards the bus. It was raining and all I could do was hold my unopened umbrella above my head as I ran. It obviously didn't help, so when I finally reached the bus stop panting and ready to fall over I was completely soaked through.\nThe bus doors were already closing when I reached it, but being desperate I managed to jam my umbrella between the gap in the doors before they closed. The door creaked rather loudly and the driver looked at me as if I were a fucking lunatic. I was still trying to catch my breath and very late so being crazy was the least of my problems.\nAfter a moment the driver grudgingly opened the doors once more. I gave him a small 'thank you' between gasps, but he just glared at me at motioned for me to take my seat.\nI sat down next to an elderly man listening to something on an old Walkman. He didn't pay me any attention, but continued to hum what sounded like dream lover.\nI pulled off my glasses and began to wipe away the rainwater as I muttered a thanks to whatever god cared enough to receive it for making it on the bus in time. I had only just started my new job and the boss was as stoic as they come, so I really couldn't\u200b afford to be late. It hadn't taken long enough to get the damn job, anyway.", "Of course I'll probably never be able keep that job now. Not with what happened about five minutes into the bus journey. One minute I was looking out to the passing storefronts with the old man now humming some blues tune and the next I had collapsed onto a hardwood floor in a room where everything was dim and smelled of old books and damp. ", "Managing to left my head up and put my now bent glasses back on, I saw that I was now in what looked like a attic. There were towers of books everywhere.\nGetting myself into a sitting position I noticed I was surrounded by what looked like candles. There were five of them and they were all black and arranged in a circle around me. There were white trails on the floor connecting the candles. It looked like paint and as I inspected the pattern I noticed it formed a star. Frowning I looked up and nearly had a heart attack. There in front of the point of the star stood an old man in what looked like a long and dark robe. He stood perfectly still with a rather heavy looking book held open in front of him in his hands. He was smiling, or rather he was smiling at me. That's when I felt a tendril of fear run up along my spine. I backed away, my heart now begining to beat very quickly as the old man smiled at me. I hit a wall and I couldn't move any further. Looking back I saw there was no wall, but for some reason the area just before the candle was solid and I could not move past it. That's when the old man spoke.\n\"That's a barrier around you, demon. You cannot move beyond it\" he said, his voice deep and grave. He looked pleased with himself. Utterly confused, I gulped and tried to speak. \n\"Ugh... who..who are you?\" I stuttered. I had meant for it to come out more level, but I had so many questions and scenarios running through my head I guess it couldn't be helped.\n\"I am Lord Alsen Bodyth of the mage council, but you may call me master, demon\" he proclaimed, sounding very proud.\nI frowned. \"De..demon?\"\n\"Yes, but not just any demon. You're my demon\" he pointed out, now grinning. That creeped me the fuck out, but all I could do was give a shaky laugh and say\n\"But... I.. I'm not a... demon\" I wasn't entirely sure of what he was talking about, but I didn't liked it.\nHe gave me an understanding look and a nod \"yes, yes, that's what they all say, but believe me demon, demon you are. I would know. I summoned you myself from the hell plain...\" He looked down to his book for a moment searching for the name. Then having found it he looked back up and, still smiling, said \"... Earth\"", "\"Save her!\"", "\"Wha-?\"", "\"I summoned you here to save her! Do it!\"", "On the table lay a woman with labored breath and covered in blood.", "\"I can't do it here. You'll have to send me back. I need an ER.\"", "\"I have an ear for you right here, demon!\" The man jiggles his own bloody ear in his hand.", "\"No, I need an E... R... An emergency room you imbecile. Send us both back and she'll be healed.\"", "\"No. No I won't do it. I won't let you make her a demon like you. They never come back the same.\"", "\"Of course they don't. You can't take a bite of the apple of knowledge and stay ignorant.\"", "\"SAVE HER, DEMON!\"", "The man standing in an arcane circle wearing a long white robe and a strange creature about his neck sighs. \"You are all fools. Damned fools.\" Then he clapped his hands and was gone. So was the woman.", "For the next month, the young sorcerer wept. He had sold his love to a demon. Then, a loud clap and the sound of something solid bouncing on the floor pulled him out of his remorse. When he approached the strange object, he saw her smiling face. Then the object spoke...", "\"Hey Joe. Thanks for helping me. It's better here. People are happy. Their babies live past infancy, infections don't kill people, and there's much less war and violence. I've decided to stay with Dr. Hapburn. He's the man you summoned to save me. He's been kind to me and he is wealthier than our king! Good luck, Joe. I don't think I'll ever see you again.\"", "Then the object went dark. Joe let out an anguished scream. \"DAMN YOU DEMON!\"", "\"Welcome back, Dr. Hapburn!\"", "\"Thanks Sally.

If I'm being honest, I felt bad for the guy. It wasn't his fault that the girl he chose to love didn't love him back. I heard a sob.", "\"Okay, so what's going on, man?\" I sit down in the circle and prepare for a long-ass story where I end up being the therapist again. Y'know, being in their version of hell really makes you go through shit and end up stronger. Sometimes I think they should visit Earth. If only I could summon them.", "The young man huffs. His breaths are jagged as he recovers from his tears. \"You aren't like any other demon I've summoned before.\"", "\"Yeah well, you're not like any sorcerer that I've been ordered around by before.\" I pause, trying to figure out how to get him smiling again. Forget it, I'll just be honest. \"The rest were just fuckers. At least you have something I can help you with. No world domination shit, okay?\"", "\"I just needed someone to talk to.\"", "I meant to suppress my guffaw.

Heh. I am technically forsaken from God, get it?", "\"Fine. What would you rather I talk about?\" ", "\"Maybe how no demon has talked to you like this before?\" he stared at me blankly. Well, I guess he doesn't have a commanding presence, usually we're pretty docile because we have no choice. \"Okay... how about the woman you mentioned.\"", "\"Oh, she's perfect,\" his eyes started to glaze over in a fucking daydream.

No wonder she didn't want to be with him.", "\"So what happened?\" ", "He adjusted to be comfortable, then he looked up at me and asked, \"Do you want a cup of water or something?\" If he wasn't so pathetic, I would cry at his kind gesture. These beings were too power hungry to ever consider if I was actually hungry.", "\"No, but thank you,\" ew, I could feel my heart softening towards this guy. By the end we might have a serious bro-mance going. Ugh, that would mean he'd summon me whenever he needed something. Shit he needed friends.", "\"O-okay. Well, you're certainly far different than any other demon I've summoned before. They usually have magical powers like I do.\"", "\"Yeah, well you called the wrong universe this time.\" I needed to get back on subject, I had other things to do today. \"Who is this girl?\"", "\"She's my best friend.\" ARE YOU SERIOUS YOU WANT TO HAVE A FRIEND ZONE CONVERSATION? Fuck me.", "\"Mmmmhmmm,\" I read somewhere that minimal attending skills were the best when you had to listen to someone. Honestly, I feel for this guy, I've been there, so I could try to have this conversation.", "\"Everyone loves her. When she walks into a room, there is always someone she knows, someone who wants to be near her. She's a magnet.\" He locked eyes with me as his eyes started to tear up, \"For some reason she chose to befriend ", ". I'm the freak magician in the corner who is too shy and too feared for anyone to approach. I am a social pariah.\" ", "\"What makes you think she doesn't love you then?\" I really have been here. I mean, usually I don't socialize because I'm awkward and I play a lot of video games, but he wanted the girl who was the belle of the ball. By some miracle I currently had her... I mean, a version of her in hell.", "\"She talks to all these guys, she's always flirting and going on dates. She never gives me a second thought when she talks to me about them.\" He was still sitting on the floor and holding his legs.", "\"Have you talked to her?\" It was obvious this guy didn't know how to talk about his feelings. Gotta love masculine expectations, they seem to be the same wherever I am summoned. Fucks the poor guys up. No wonder they all want to control a demon. Still doesn't excuse this shit though.", "\"I mentioned that I can't really help her with her guy problems.\" She sometimes gets frustrated with me then doesn't talk to me for a few days when that happens.", "\"... But have you asked her on a date?\"", "\"No...\"", "\"WHY THE HELL NOT? If you are going to summon a demon, who could be potentially dangerous, don't you think it should be your final resort?\" ", "\"I am your master and you are berating me!\" The girl is definitely a touchy subject. At least the yelling made this interesting, so I continued.", "\"As soon as I leave I HAVE no fucking master. You know what's so funny? You want to make this WOMAN your slave. That's what you told me as soon as I arrived. Taking away her choice, just like you took away mine, I guess that sounds a lot like love in this world.\" Oops, might have stepped on a few nerves.", "The sorcerer just stood there and said nothing. He bowed his head. \"You're right. If I could force her to love me, I would do it. It would be for her own good too. I'd take care of her every wish or desire.\"", "\"Except one -- her freedom. That's the most important one for a relationship. Otherwise you'd only have a hollow semblance of one.\" I really did feel for this guy, but I've never wanted to control the girl. At the time, I just wished the girls on Earth had liked me.", "\"I'd rather have that than not have her at all.\" He stood up in defiance.", "\"Well, I still can't help you with that.\" I looked at his determined and slightly terrifying face. I take it back, he could command a demon, there was sheer power there.", "\"Then you're useless.\"", "\"Or maybe you're useless.\"", "\"What did you say?\"", "\"You heard me. I thought you weren't like those other sorcerers, and I was right. You're worse.\"", "\"You're just a shit demon who has to be a slave for all eternity, it doesn't matter what you think.\" ", "I couldn't keep myself from saying it, \"I guess that's why you have no friends and no lover.\"", "He stormed out and I sat there until a candle burned all of it's wick. Finally the circle was broken and I could go home. I saw the sorcerer run into the room as I prepared to leave.", "\"Go to therapy, man. Only dicks don't get the girl.\" Then I vanished, back into the puff of smoke and back in my bed with my girlfriend.", "\"Good morning, love. Who did you have to talk to this time?\" She yawned and wrapped her arm around me.", "\"Myself. In an alternate universe.\" She sat up and looked at me intently, I noticed she only had her t-shirt on. This was the universe I wanted to be in.", "\"Are you okay?\" She reached for my hair as she searched my eyes.", "\"I am now.\" My cheeky grin made her smile. I felt sorry for that guy and I hoped he'd change for the better like I did. As my girlfriend started to get out of bed I pulled her back. \"Where do you think you're going?\"", "She laughed. I definitely hoped this guy would learn his lesson and experience this kind of satisfaction. For my sake.", "He stood there, holding an odd looking book, a smug look on his face, almost as if he expected something from me.  I'm sure my confusion showed on my face, but he started babbling at me in some vaguely Latinesque sounding mish-mash.

It felt like someone sticking a needle in your arm and promising to take it away if you made them a sandwich. Painful, but also just ", ". ", "It was at this point that I also noticed the headache.

Finally he spoke something non-scripted, but if I'm being honest, it wasn't much better.  \"Foul tempter, I won't listen to your requests!  You are here to do ", " bidding, not the other way around.  I'm prepared for your temptations, and I won't be swayed by them!\"", "He went back to chanting, and I sighed. As he chanted, my skin started prickling more and more, until it felt like a million angry ladybugs marching forcefully across my entire body.  With cleats on.  Finally I shouted.  \"Look! I don't know who you are, or what I'm doing here, but can you just explain it to me?  I'm tired, this feels weird, and all I want is to go home.  Can we make that happen? What would that take?\"", "He stopped the chanting, looking annoyed.  He glanced at the book three or four times, then finally set it down.  Very carefully.", "\"Demon of the Unholy Realms.  I have summoned you here to do my bidding.  To grant me power and knowledge beyond that of my enemies.  Grant me this power, and I will return you to your Uncouth Hell.\"", "\"Do what now?\"  I've been called some names during my life--who hasn't?--but demon?  That seemed extreme.

After all, some days I don't have to go outside.  But it's hardly representative of the rest of the world, and it was pretty clear this guy wasn't operating on the same mental playing field as pretty much anyone I'd met before.  Possibly not even the same mental planet.", "He gave me a look that said that just maybe he was catching on to my utter confusion.  That lasted long enough to make me even more uncomfortable.  Finally he said, \"Ah, this is pretty simple really.  Standard contract, you know.  I summon you, you grant me a portion of your power in return for your named price--often my soul, but negotiable--and then you return to the Unholy Realms whence all demons come.  Simple, straight-forward.  Except...\"  he paused to lick his lips, \"Except you seem confused by all this, and I can't imagine why.  I'm certain that I've done this correctly.  The instruction were not difficult.  So, demon, I ask you what are you playing at?  What is your temptation for me?\"", "I frowned.  Okay, so he recognized I was trying to show confusion, but thought it was fake.  The Bastard.  That's when I named him, in my head.  Moving on. \"First off,\" I started, possibly showing some anger, \"I am not a demon.  I am a human.  I'm from New Jersey, not, as you say, the Unholy Realms, though I will acknowledge that Jersey ain't the sweetest place in the world.

But, alas, my mouth ", ", and never was, made to produce those sounds.  I've probably misspelled whatever he said.  But he beamed at me, picked up his book, read a long passage, making it sound like the trippiest possible version of a Gregorian Chant, and just like that, I was...home?", "Yeah, home, but for some reason I can just barely make out horns on a lot people's skulls.  Jersey devil indeed.", "With a heavy sigh I got out of bed. My body ran on autopilot as I got through my usual morning routine: shower, shave, breakfast. I looked at the clock, dreading as it neared 9am.", "\"I guess I should get going...\" I said with disdain. ", "The walk to the bus felt like an eternity. It was pure torture. Normally people would cherish the time they spent away from their jobs as they would try and enjoy this time for themselves. All I kept thinking was the hatred towards every minute that passed by, bringing me closer to my job.", "The bus got here on time, as usual. Groaning, I walk up to the bus's steps, the driver smiling his goofy smile. How I envy his happiness.", "After the usual greetings I proceed to my solitary seat in the back. The bus takes off as I close my eyes, resting me head on the window. Just thinking about my job gives me a headache. My supervisor coming in and hassling me in my cubicle.

My eyes adjust to the dark room I've suddenly appeared in, the only source of light coming from the candles surrounding me. ", "'Is... is that a demonic star I'm standing in?' I think to myself.", "As my eyes adjust I notice 2 figures, shaking in fear in the corner. ", "\"I didn't think this would actually work! I thought it was just a fiction book! He looks tall. I wonder how tall he is.\" I kept hearing from their direction. ", "\"Umm... I'm 6 foot 2.\" I answer.", "\"Ah! H- he can read minds!\" One of the girls yells out. She struggles to find her composure, straightening up as best she can and walks forward, still shaking. ", "\"I- I am the one who summoned you. You must obey me!\" She yells out, her voice breaking. It sounds like she's near crying. ", "\"Oh, this was so stupid of me. I shouldn't have done this. I bet he's angry. He's a demon. Of course he's gonna be angry. He won't want to help me at all. Am I gonna for? I dont want to die.\"", "She kept saying all these things but I noticed one thing. Her lips weren't moving. She was still shaking. Ugh. This headache was getting worse. And I could also hear her friend in the back.", "\"It was a joke. Maybe if I explain it to him he'll spare me. I didn't believe summoning these demons was possible. Our magic isn't strong enough to summon these demons. I just wanted to make her feel better. Me and my stupid ideas.\"", "She wasn't talking either. I really can read minds.", "\"What do you want?\" I bellow out. More because of the headache than the situation as I rub my temples.", "\"Oh, well um...\" she stammers out. Struggling to find her words. Her mind is talking clearly however. ", "\"I should be honest. No... maybe I should just send him back to hell. But if he can help me out it would be useful.

Just like ignoring someone in real life.' I think to myself.", "\"I- I know that making a deal requires me to give you something. I don't have much but I can offer you artifacts, money or...\" she continues to stammer.", "\"I don't really feel like going back to... where I come from.\" I say, interrupting her. ", "\"I'll help you out. As for what I want... I'll decide on that when I finish helping you.\"", "\"O- ok... I can see why you wouldn't want to go back to hell with your ears and tail ripped off.\" ", "I raise and eyebrow as the girl takes off her hood, revealing cat ears underneath.", "This is going to be interesting.

I found myself still sitting at my desk in a brightly-lit cavern stone cavern. Every surface had been buffed to a high shine. There was a circle of what looked like tiny birthday candles around me--each of them brighter than a halogen floodlight. I rolled back in my office chair, and hit an invisible force-field. It flickered and hissed where my chair touched it, but held firm. Several high-pitched voices began chanting softly in unison,", "\"Oh demon of the foulest Earth, we have summoned you here and now bind you to our will! Do not test the might the warlocks of the Cabal of Illuamdmitae, for we have power beyond imagining...\"", "I stood up as the speech continued, and began to look around for the speakers. In front of my desk were three tiny figures--each barely a meter high--clad in shimmering, almost-iridescent red robes. The fabric was unlike anything I had seen before.

", "\"Excuse me,\" I interrupted. \"What's going on?\"", "The robed figures covered their ears in pain. The leader handed the other two what appeared to be lumps of beeswax. \"Do not attempt to injure us with your foul voice, demon, for we have taken precautions!\" ", "I tried to whisper now. \"Okay. One, I'm not a demon. Two, where in the hell am I? Three, who are you?\"", "\"We, your masters, have summoned you from the foulest Earth to achieve a lasting victory in our age-old conflict with the oath-breaking Raelian Horde.\"", "\"Umm, you do realize that I'm a lawyer, right?

It was like there were two pictures on top of each other. Then slowly the picture behind began to grow stronger and the one in front began to fade. Like seeing something become clear through a fog, only the fog wasn\u2019t fog it was reality. Though at the same time, he heard the noise from his video games begin to fade and was replaced by chanting. The last sounds he heard from his old world was Jim crying out after a loud crack.", "He felt sleepy, and really didn\u2019t want to move at all. Some weird old dudes were chanting, dressed in robes, and whoa was this weird. Man, he felt odd, slow even. The chanting stopped and Jerry realized he was kneeling upon a stone floor. He rubbed his hands across the floor and the stone rubbed off as if it was just talc. ", "His mind started to lose its befuddlement. He closed his hand into a fist not realizing how he easily crushed the floor between his fingers. He was strong, no he was what the strong aspired to be, he was superior. He leaned his head to the side trying to get a better look, the men were clearly monks, but something was off. They seemed to be in slow motion.", "He slowly stood and cautiously got close to them. It took them 2 seconds too long to react, and when they did it was with startled fear. Jerry thought it was kinda of funny how faces move in slow motion from a concentrantrated one. To one that just says, \"huh?\" Then they were panicking in slow motion, and the fear was clear across their faces. One of them started to move their hands in a grand gesture and the light from his candle began to grow bigger. Jerry thought it kind of looked like a ball.", "He casually stepped closer to it, and it got bigger and Jerry realized that it was for sure a ball, and it was moving towards him now. He then hopped to the side and looked at the dude that had cast it at him. His look clearly said what he whispered, \u201cWhat the hell man?\u201d Why he whispered, he didn't know, that weird monk held a book. He thought maybe they were in a library.", "He came back to the present and gave the man his full attention and while reading his lips and somehow picking out his voice amongst of the loudest sounds he had ever heard in his life. \u201cOh Heavens no, it is a demon. We must end it now!\u201d His fireball had fully engulfed the poor soul behind him, Jerry could barely stand how the stench of the man\u2019s bubbling skin enveloped his nostrils. It was a wonderfully grotesque experience, Jerry realized he hadn\u2019t ever smelled something as deeply as this. ", "Now that he thought about it, colors were more vivid, sharper. He focused his eyes on the man\u2019s eyes. He could see so well that he could make eye contact with his own eyes in the man\u2019s eye\u2019s reflection. HD TV\u2019s no longer meant shit to him. He felt a new force, it was time. He let it flow through his fingers, and with just a slight wave of his hand he slowed it to almost what was almost a stop for him before the shouting started to sound normal and coherent to him.", "\u201cWait,\u201d he shouted and the noise was deafening to him. It had clearly been deafening to the monks too, for all of them recoiled and covered their ears. The flames on the burning man, died down and two others were able to put him out. His skin was blackened and charred, Jerry knew he was dead, he couldn\u2019t hear his heartbeat anymore. These other guys though, they were putting on the meanest drum solo he had ever heard.", "Then Jerry realized there was one monk, no a sorcerer standing just fine and unaffected behind what was clearly a barrier spell. She was by far the most devilishly divine woman he had ever laid eyes upon. She was the one clutching the book, no tome, ever so gently. it had clearly been a source of her knowledge. She had plans for him, of that he was certain. He saw those plans clear in her mind, and smiled.", "He strode up to her, reached out and grasped her barrier in his hands and summoned it to focus within his fist. \u201cYou\u2019ll need this no longer love, we\u2019re going to have to trust each other.\u201d He then tossed the magic above and expanded it to include them all. The power was quickly going to his head, what kind of cocky douche would say that? One that held all the power in the world, and did he? Maybe.", "He blinked and the monks were healed. He knew they all believed where they lived was earth and where he lived was Hell. This kinda made sense to him, I mean in a way his life really was Hell at times. He had felt so lonely, so out of place. Never loved, only wanted for his talents, not just for him. He had really felt like he had never belonged there. ", "Then he felt their pain, their sorrows, their lives. He didn\u2019t walk a mile in their shoes, he lived all their lives simultaneously and in an instant. He knew exactly how to manipulate all of them, but what was the cost of all this power? And then he knew as the men withered and died in front of him. He had drained their life force, their souls. What remained faded into their afterlife. Two went back to what he called home. ", "He reached out to them and said, \u201cOkay if that really is Hell, if you\u2019re born into America. Life really isn\u2019t so bad, can\u2019t really say much about the rest of the world. For us at least man you can do pretty much anything if you focus. Honestly at times I had the whole world at my fingertips but I can\u2019t remember ever being happier than swinging as high as I could on a warm summer day on the big kid swings.\u201d", "That\u2019s when he figured out the meaning to life. That was it, doing something you didn\u2019t think you could do. He snapped back to his new reality. The reasons those men were going to hell were good ones. He relived the darkness of their deeds, of how they enjoyed them. How they knew what they were doing was wrong, but had chosen to do it anyways. All for foolish reasons, greed, envy, power, jealously.", "Mortals, were such ugly creatures. Whoa . . . . bad path, but maybe kinda a good one. I mean he did have the power to cleanse them. He could shepherd them into a new age . . . . The sorcerer looked him over in admiration. He realized his thinking was wrong, she was a sorceress. ", "Then before he overloaded himself with all the new knowledge, he turned it off. He stopped absorbing. He put a hand to his head to quite the pain inside. He reached out to the monks going to Hell to remind them of one last thing. Hey 1 year apart from each other you\u2019re going to randomly get in touch with my friend Jim. He was playing xbox with me when I disappeared in a cloud of smoke. Or at least that\u2019s how he experienced it.\u201d", "A smile stretched across his face as he continued. \u201cTell him demon\u2019s have immense power on earth and I am thinking about reshaping it into a utopia, because holy shit I experience things so fucking vividly right now it\u2019s single handedly the most amazing thing to ever happen to me as well as the worst. Oh dear God it can be so bad. I\u2019m not sure if things are going to turn out the way I would hope they would.\u201d", "The smile had began to fade as he continued, \u201cI kinda think just sitting out of everything is the best way to go, the power man, it\u2019s wild. I just drained some dudes of their lives by accident. I\u2019m pretty sure that gave me a huge boost in my powers. I\u2019m so damn smart now man, I can like, live other people's lives in an instant. At least that\u2019s the best way I know how to describe it to you. Do you really think that\u2019s healthy man? I\u2019m all kinds of twisted up right now man, trying to grasp all this. It\u2019s wild.\u201d", "\u201cAnyways, I know how to summon you, but I am pretty sure it\u2019s a really bad idea. It requires a lot of not so great things to happen and I don\u2019t think I want this on your consciousness.\u201d Then the smile vanished completely as he realized all he could actually do at this point to save his friend from all of this and to lend as much comfort as possible was to leave him be. \u201cNever mind monks, forget all that.\u201d He hoped his friend would be smart enough to never tell a soul. He was thankful that his phone had been watered damaged a week ago in a flood. If everyone stayed quiet, no one would be blamed.", "He had meant well, but at his command they had forgotten everything he had just said, including the words of wisdom before it. He snapped back to his new reality. He looked at the sorcerer, who was the girl. \u201cSo you\u2019re a sorceress not a sorcerer.\u201d", "She cocked her oh so perfect head to the side, \u201cNo, Hell knows about us, but some things you get wrong. You have embellished tales in the wrong ways as you have gone about your torments. I am a sorcerer, those who can not perform magic are sorcerer-less. Shortened by the ignorant to sorceress. Which as you always do in Hell push it off on the females to be called something from less. The males rule Hell, the women rule Heaven, but we share Earth!\u201d She had fire, he liked that, but what had made her that way. He called for her memories, only they never came.", "A wicked grin appeared across his face, and a glint could have blinked in his eye. He wanted what he couldn\u2019t have, shouldn\u2019t have. Whoa, he thought as he shook his head. Tried to banish the final one. The one he had dodged around. The one that told him how easily he could take it, the memories of her life, her secrets, her very being. He could violate her in the most personal way possible and her not even be aware. Or . . . . or at least so he thought. I mean he could always test the waters. Anyways . . . . who could stop him? ", "No . . . they had to trust. At least for now, besides . . . he could always just take the information if he felt like he needed to. Then that way it's not bad, it's in self defense. . . . right?", "Just another day. That's how it started at least. I woke up around 4:30 pm and started getting ready for my night shift. This whole grown up adult job thing wasn't all it had cracked up to be. Twelve hour shifts in a cramped room dealing with all the idiots my city had to offer. I guess you could say it was like hell on earth.", "As I stepped outside and turned to lock my apartment behind me, I felt an odd sensation. Like something was about to happen but. I could say what. Just as I was about to shrug it off and take the short stroll to my car, a plume of smoke that smelled of sulfur enveloped me. And then everything went black.", "When my vision finally returned, I almost thought I had somehow teleported to work. Small space, dimly lit. Felt like work for sure. But as the blurriness cleared from my eyes, I started to notice things. Candles. All in a circle and chalk lines between them. In the corner stood a figure, but I couldn't make anything else out at first.", "\"It worked!\" came a shout from the figures direction. \"Holy hell it actually worked!\" The excitement in the figures voice was almost palpable. \"Now that you're here, I can finally call myself a summoner!\" the unknown figure said as it approached me.", "The figure entered the candle lit circle and stood just a few feet from me. I could see now it was a young woman, maybe 25. She wasn't unattractive either with bright green eyes and a curly blonde hair. Then it hit me like a sledgehammer. What the actual hell is going on here?", "\"A summoner? Listen, I don't know how you got me here or what you're expecting but you're gonna have to catch me up here. Number one, where am I? Number two, forget that I need to get to work.\" I said with a mix of bewilderment and frustration.", "\"You're on earth. I summoned you here so I could finally be a summoner. Summoning an actual demon is the last part of the initiation.\" I looked at the young woman with an almost extreme amount of incredulity.", "\"You've got to be kidding me. Wow. It's not enough that I somehow managed to get Kidnapper but to get kidnapped by a fanatic about some kinda demon cult. This is icing on the cake\" I spat out as I turned to leave the circle and find the exit. What? Was she gonna stop a grown man from getting out of here? As if.", "\"You can't leave yet\" she said from behind me very calmly. I ignored her and kept searching for a door. A window. Anything that could get me out of here. \"You gonna stop me?\" I shot back at her. \"I have a job to get to and bills to pay. Whatever fantasy or lunacy is going on with you, leave me out of it and get some other gullible sap to play with you\" I added over my shoulder. \"I for one---\"", "Suddenly I was whisked away from that dimly lit room. Before I even know what had happened I was standing next to a car that had its bonnet wrapped around a tree and a fire hydrant next to it spouting water freely into the air. Next to me stood a familiar face with a look on his face only comparable to that of a teenager telling his dad that he took the car without permission. ", "I looked at the scene and then back at the man. \"Don't worry Kevin, you're covered!\" I barely got the words out before being transported back to my work office to type up the paperwork for Mr. Kevin and his claim before being whisked away on another claim.", "I hate this job. ", "Two thankless years pandering to the whims of a boss who still can't remember my name and calls me Jimmy. My name is Jonathan. It's Jonathan! ", "But I'm spineless. I can't face up to his authoritative and domineering personality and honestly, he plain scares the shit out of me. ", "I'm so done with this job... done, done, do....", "Fuck! My eyes sear with pain abruptly. I can't see anything bar a blinding light. A feeling of weightlessness washes over my body and I hit the ground. It wasn't cheap carpet like I'd expect falling off of my chair at work.", "It was stone. Cold, hard, unforgiving stone and it felt like my bones disintegrated against it.

Before I could even think about what kind of special effects it took to do that so realistically, a large clawed hand shot out of it and gripped me by the face. Between its fingers, I could see the tendril of an arm growing thinner until it fit perfectly within the stain. Vainly, my eyes struggled to find help, I didn't care who from. The bus around me was animated, but nobody saw me. The homeless man actually stood up at the next stop and passed right through me on his way out. A young couple standing slightly behind my seat scrambled to fill it, the woman sitting square inside of me. I'm sure the inside of the human skull is an interesting to be, but I still needed light to see apparently. I could feel the lurch of the bus starting again, my mind still unable to comprehend what was happening to me.", "A second lurch caught me off guard and I was flung head first into the darkness. I'm not sure how long I stayed in that abyss, it could have been a second, it could have been years. How can you quantify time when there is no passage of it?", "Out of the darkness grew a faint orange light. Wordlessly, I reached for it, striving with every fiber of my being to reach it. The warmness of the light rushed towards me and there was suddenly ground beneath me. There were notes of dust, flickering candles, and me, speeding out of a hole in the air at 15 miles an hour. The force of my ejection flung me across the room, my body crashing through candle stands and a table. Coming to a violent halt, I slumped against the wall, my vision wavering between black and light.", "\"Eeeeeeeeeehehehehehe-\" the high pitched cackle of a shriveled old man standing in front of me was cut off as he bent over and started coughing loudly.

You are my tool now, Lord of Hell!\"", "Finally able to move, I push myself to my feet, looking at my hands and legs in astonishment. I felt no pain from that crash, in fact I felt better than I had in my entire life. A strange sensation flowed through me, my veins welling with every beat of my heart.

What did you do to me?\"", "The man looked surprised for a second before swallowing quickly, \"You're in Norsia and I have made you my slave. My orders are absolutely binding! I have done what none else dared! I have summoned a demon!\" The man raised his arms in the air in triumph as he turned around. I took the time to reflect on this strange sensation, opening and closing my hand in front of my face, trying to mentally piece together what was happening.", "\"Now, come, come,\" the man pointed to a chair next to me, \"I will lay out my plans for you.\" I took the noted chair and he sat down in another across from me, \"You are my demon now, the first in a thousand years! I have enemies that need to be disposed of and only you can handle their destruction. Now, as a demon I'm sure you're proficient in all schools, but what are you best with?\"", "My voice caught for a brief second before I could reply, still overwhelmed by all of this, \"I-I'm sorry, schools?\"", "He gave me a curious look before explaining, \"Schools of magic. As a demon I'm sure you're well versed in shade, flame, and soul. Any other specializations?\"", "\"I don't even know what you're talking about! I've nev-\"", "\"SILENCE! I will not have my slave talk back to me!\" His eyes filled with a yellow light and pain raced through my body. I collapsed off of my chair, convulsing involuntarily as my body twitched and twisted from the unpleasant stimulation. \"Now, you will go to Dala, the nearest village. You will wipe it out, I wish for there to be no survivors!\" The pain subsided, but it was replaced by an urge. And urge to do the man's bidding no matter the order.", "I cried out, rage, despair, and anguish wracked my body before I slowly stood, a deep and aching need burning in my gut. I nodded at him, unable to stop myself, \"It will be done. No survivors.\" Not knowing what I was doing myself, I decided to just will my magic to work. With a wave of my hand, I took a step forward and found myself in blinding sunlight. A gently sloping hill was laid out before me, a sparkling sea lapped at a shore in the distance. I could hear the songs of a hundred different birds floating on the gentle breeze. My hair ruffled in the wind for a moment before I turned around to see the rest of my surroundings, coming face to face with what I could only assume was the village of Dala.", "A tear fell from my eye as I strolled inside the village. The people gave me cautious looks, my outlandish attire a rarity in their quaint place. Walking to the center of town, a small group gathered around me.

He smacked me in the back to get me out of there.", "When I got back to my house, it was about 9:00 in the morning. I went to go throw away my noodle cup, but then when I looked in the trashcan, I found the remnants of the candy bars I threw away a few days ago to be gone.

", "\"Fuck this,\" I said walking away just before her hand reached my ankle. I stopped and snapped another picture of the woman on the floor. Walking down the stairs I was getting pretty pissed off at all of these interruptions. I was just passing the pool when I stopped. The water had turned to blood. ", "I snapped another picture.", "As I walked down the corridor to the lobby, a man with a chainsaw sprung out of the vending area, he pulled the rip cord and started flailing the chainsaw in my general direction.", "\"Hey...HEY!\" I yelled. He killed the motor. \"It is three o'clock in the goddamn morning, asshole. This is a hotel. Do you honestly feel like that shit can't wait until morning?\"", "\"Uhh...sorry I just...\"", "\"You just what? You're standing in a hotel jumping out with a chainsaw at random strangers at three o'clock in the morning? Does that fucking sound normal to you? Go the fuck to sleep.\" I snapped a picture as I walked away. The stranger seemed confused and a little embarrassed. ", "Walking to the front lobby I reached into my pocket and pulled out my wallet. Slapping my rewards card on the counter I looked at the woman doing the night audit. ", "\"I'm a damn Diamond member. And I can't sleep in this place with all of this bullshit...\"", "\"Oh, I'm sorry, sir. What seems to be the problem?\"", "Swiping the screen on my phone I turn it to her. ", "\"Oozing walls, swamp chicks, pools of blood and some asshole with a chainsaw? Are you fucking kidding me? Is this Detroit?\"", "\"Well, I'm sorry sir, it is our desire to ensure you have the most comfortable stay possible...\" her voice was somewhat ominous. I gave zero fucks.", "\"I want my room comped, I want an upgrade, I want another complimentary bottled water and I want some fucking quiet for the rest of the night. Can you do that or do I have to call member services?\"", "\"Oh, yes sir, we would be happy to make all of your dreams come true...\"", "Swiping the phone again I called the member services number. ", "\"Yeah, I'm at one of your hotels and there is an obnoxious amount of creepy shit going on. Pool is filled with blood, there's a dude with a chainsaw, my wall is oozing blood and this lady at the front desk is talking in a weird ass tone that seems to imply pending doom...yeah, how'd you guess where...hold on...\"", "I handed the front desk clerk the phone. \"They want to talk to you.\" ", "Suddenly the sullen woman's eyes softened and she gulped a bit as she took the phone.", "\"...Hello? Well, yes, uhh, Julia. No but I...right but...okay.\" She handed the phone back to me and looked contrite.", "\"I apologize for any inconvenience, sir. I'm upgrading you to a suite for the remainder of your stay, at no charge of course. And I guarantee that there will be no disturbances from here on out. I'll have your complimentary water brought up to the room and I'll be giving you double rewards points for your stay.\"", "\"Well, thanks, what the hell did member services say you to?\"", "She looked uneasy and then finally spoke. \"They said to cut the theatrical bullshit or they'd cut our franchise...\"", "\"Holy shit, Dave! Look at your fucking face!\"", "\"Oh come on. It's not that bad.\"", "\"Are you kidding?!?\"", "\"It's not like it hurt.\"", "\"Dave, they tattooed pentagrams EVERYWHERE.\"", "\"Oh like I didn't know that, Carl.\"", "\"Well you don't seem very upset about it!\"", "\"It's not the 1950's anymore, man. People aren't judgey about tattoos anymore.\"", "\"SHHH. I think I hear someone coming.\"", "\"Oh yeah, they said something about \"The Virgin Ritual\" when they were bringing me back.\"", "\"Are you kidding me?! You didn't think to say anything sooner??!!?\"", "\"What? Jokes on them right? Neither of us are virgins.\"", "\"...\"", "\"Oh my god, Carl. Hahaha. Are you serious?! You're 37! How have you never had sex?\"", "\"This isn't helpful, Dave.\"", "\"Well maybe they just wanna help you get laid? You never know.\"", "\"THERE WERE ARMS ALL OVER THE FLOOR WHEN THEY WALKED US IN.\"", "\"Yeah, so maybe they just wanna 'give you a hand'.\" ", "EDIT: I did NOT expect gold on this. Thank you, kind stranger! (I've always wanted to say that)", "\"Well that's just fucking brilliant. Look at this cliche-ass mess of a house.\" Cyrus and his companion, Arel, stood before a large, battered old house, atop an abnormally steep hill.  ", "\"This IS pretty cliche, I have to admit. Even the shutters on the windows are flapping in the wind,\" Arel responded.  ", "\"Typically, there is no wind,\" Cyrus looked up to the higher floors and shouted towards them, \"There's no fucking wind, you dopey twats! This doesn't even make any sense!\"  ", "He caught a glimpse of a partially transparent girl, who moved out of view, behind a curtain.  ", "\"Yeah, you! I'm talking to you, you ghost-ass shit! Fuck me, why do they even bother.\"  ", "Cyrus half-heartedly walked up to the front door, and reached out to grab the door handle. As his hand wrapped around the metal, a soft voice whistled through the wind, \"Go... back...\"  ", "\"Hmm, gee, let me think about this. How about... no! I'm down to my last ten quid, and that weird family down at the shack that all speak simultaneously in monotonous voices, promised me two hundred to come clear you nerds out. I mean, it's pretty obvious they're in on this too, now I think about it. Probably should have just outright mugged them, there and then, but I guess it's too late for that now, because their house in the middle of the woods has probably mysteriously disappeared, or some dumb shit like that,\" Cyrus was not happy being here, and despite his long rant at the voice in the breeze, he rather quickly opened the door to the haunted house. Not to his surprise, the other side of the door was bricked up.  ", "\"Holy shit, where do you guys find your bloody architects? Why put a door on a brick wall? How is this even meant to be scary? Maybe if I was an architect myself, with a major cased of OCD, but I'm neither an architect, nor do I have OCD. This is just slightly irritating. What have you ghosts come to, that your only ability, is to 'slightly irritate' us mere mortals?\" he threw his hands up in annoyance, then turned to Arel, who passed him a sledgehammer, \"See, I COULD go and search around the back of the house, as you clearly want me to, but that requires walking, and I'm not much of a walking type, so...\" he swung at the wall, then again and again, \"I'm not going to make a 'here's Cyrus' joke. I'm not dropping to your level.\"  ", "The two stepped through the opening, in to a room much larger than the outside implied, \"and now spatial distortion, such scary, much haunt, wow. You see what you're doing to me? Now I'm spouting dank memes, just to make this experience seem somewhat worth it. Arel, hand me the matches, let's burn this place down.\" but no response came, \"Arel?\" he turned around, but she wasn't there.  ", "\"Oh my god... Arel! AREL! Where are you?! YOU BASTARDS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH- nah, I'm just kidding, I don't give a shit,\" he walked to one of the doors on the edge of the room, \"Oh boy, I wonder, could she possibly be behind this door with-\" the light of the room flickered as silhouettes of a group of children rushed past a nearby window, accompanied by the sound of youthful laughter.  ", "\"Shut the fuck up! I'm trying to be witty, here!\" he yelled towards the window, then turned back to the door, \"I was saying: Could she possibly be behind this door with the Satanic looking symbols on it, and the words 'Help me, Cyrus' scratched below them? What a real mystery this is turning out to be!\", the door handle was surrounded by a series of ancient looking padlock devices. As Cyrus reached out to examine one, it began to morph in to a distressed looking face, and let out a haunting scream.  ", "\"Holy fuck, Ebenezer Scrooge wants his door back, what the fuck, guys. A Christmas Carol is literally the LEAST haunting thing I've ever read. No, what am I saying? Calling this Ebenezer Scrooge's door is too much of a compliment, this is more like Scrooge McDuck's door.\"  ", "He stepped back to examine the other doors in the room that had now changed aesthetically to that of a rusting asylum. Cyrus rolled his eyes, \"Seven doors and seven locks. So I guess I'm supposed to go through these too spoopy rooms and find each key, huh?\"  ", "He hefted the sledgehammer over his shoulder, \"not today, matey.\"  ", "With full force, he brought the hammer down on the locks, knocking them out of place. The door swung open.  ", "On the other side, Cyrus saw a dark room, where Arel was tied to a post with a red bracelet in front of her, and surrounded by a circle of candles, \"Hey, Arel,\" Cyrus nodded to her. \"'sup\", she replied.  ", "He stepped in to the room, and the door slammed closed behind him.", "\n\"I was going to tell you this was a trap, but it seemed like a waste of breath,\" Arel said, shrugging her shoulders.", "\n\"No shit,\" replied Cyrus, as he ran a hand across his face in annoyance.  ", "From the shadows of each of the four corners of the room, stepped a person. The members of the family that had requested the two go to this house, in the first place.  ", "Cyrus spread his arms out, and looked up at the ceiling, \"WHAT A TWIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIST\" he cried aloud, then looking around at his assailants again, he asked, \"so which of you has the two hundred bucks?\"  ", "They slowly began to walk towards him, each brandishing a rusty dagger in their right hand.  ", "\"Well those knives aren't going to sell for shit, they're all rusted up. Fuck it.\" he swung the hammer down on the bracelet in front of Arel, shattering it. The four family members screamed, as their bodies lit up in a bright white light, illuminating the room, and then as suddenly as it had began, the lights faded in to nothingness. Cyrus and Arel remained alone, in the leftovers of a dilapidated house.", "\"Fuck off, even the bracelet disappeared. Some of the jewels in that could have sold for a few bucks,\" Cyrus dropped the sledgehammer and threw his arms up again, in disbelief.  ", "\"Man, that was a waste of time,\" Arel said standing up and brushing herself down.  ", "\"Fuck our lives, Arel. Fuck our lives.\"", "The creepy laughter started right on time.  Every night, at 11:56.  Then, the walls started to bleed, up by the ceiling, near the elaborate crown moulding, running down the old wallpaper. I call it \"dripping crimson on a field of posies.\"", "That would be gone by morning.", "Cue screaming and the sounds of someone being chased down the hall at 2:07. They'd come back in 38 minutes. I'm surprised he hasn't caught her yet. It's been months of this happening every night. That's \"Freddie and Edith on their evening stroll.\"", "At least the lamp only flew across the room that first night.  I gave it a few days to fix itself and left the broken shards in a pile, but no. It would have been nice to have a light.  But I had a kindle, so I could still read in the dark. Since it only happened once, I didn't call it anything but the pile was \"ode to a lamp\" before I swept it up. Now it's \"don't walk barefoot in that corner because you might have missed some\".", "Ohhh...banging on the bedroom door!  That's new. A nice change of pace. In ten minutes, the ghostly wolf would emerge through the closet door and pin me to the bed, menacing with dripping fangs.  Man, he needed a breath mint. His breath smelled like sewer and dead fish and broccoli. \"Mr. Stinky Breath\", I call him.", "Right on time, I hear the snarl and placed my kindle on the nightstand, holding my breath as his weight pins my arms to the mattress. I roll my eyes and try not to inhale.", "In five days, when I'd stayed in the haunted house for exactly 4 months, I'd get my $1,000,000.  Barney better pay up, or I'm gonna feed him to Mr. Stinky Breath or see if he wants to go on a stroll with Freddie and Edith.", "So there I was, driving all of my friends to this cabin that one of them owns\u2026 Gavin, I think it was. He said we're all gonna have a fun time catching fish or some shit like that, I don't give a fuck. The only reason they even invited me was because I'm the only one with a goddamned car. My friends are pretty much all assholes. ", "So we arrived at the cabin, right in the middle of fucking nowhere. Everyone else was super excited for some fucking reason, like c'mon, it's just a cabin. If it were up to me, I would have sold the cabin, and bought us rooms in a five-star hotel. Anyways, Gavin tells us all about these plans he has to go fishing. Stacey and Alex keep on being flirty with each other. They've been together for two goddamn months now, and they still act like fucking teenagers. Trevor meanwhile, warned us about some sort of urban legend. I didn't pay attention, something about a chainsaw. I don't believe in that crap. There\u2019s a few others here, but I didn\u2019t even bother learning their fucking names, they\u2019re not important. I tried to browse the net while he was telling us all about Chainsaw Willy or whoever, I\u2019m not gonna remember the fucking name, but there's no goddamn reception. Great trip Gavin, I told my girlfriend I\u2019d call her when I got here, how the fuck am I going to do that now.", "Anyways, a few hours in we start hearing mysterious noises in the cabin. I suggest we check it out, but Gavin, being the idiot he is, just wants to keep fishing. Whatever, it's your fucking cabin Gavin. I don't know why you're so goddamned obsessed with fishing anyways. After a little while longer of me resisting the temptation to drown myself in the lake, Gavin gets tired of fishing, and we head back to the cabin, only to find a whole bunch of bloodstains on the walls. Like, it's goddamned everywhere. I mean, the decor of this cabin was ugly before, but now it's fucking awful. I hope Gavin cleans it up, at least then I won't have to hear him talk about fucking fish again. ", "After some investigation, it turns out that it was Trevor\u2019s blood. He looks like he was gutted open with a chainsaw. I never liked the fucker anyways. I'm pretty sure he\u2019s been sleeping with my girlfriend. ", "Naturally, everyone else is freaking out, as if they never saw a horror movie in their lives. Like an idiot, Gavin suggests we split up and search for the killer. Great fucking plan Gavin. Whatever, I head outside for a smoke.", "As I stand outside, smoking, I eventually hear screams coming from inside. Probably Stacey and Alex next. Good riddance. They probably ruined the seats of my car with all their friskiness. Eventually Gavin manages to find me, he's got fucking tears in his eyes. He tells me all about how Stacey and Alex were brutally torn apart in the shower. Why the fuck were they even in the shower anyways? There's a psycho killer in the cabin and their only concern was getting frisky with each other. Good lord my friends are idiots as well as assholes. Eventually Gavin pleads with me to find a hiding spot with him, I try to tell him to piss off, but he just keeps on nagging me about it until I give in. So we hide in the fucking closet together. I try to make a joke about Gavin coming out of the closet, but he doesn't find it funny, like what the fuck Gavin, stop being such a stuck-up douche.", "Eventually, the closet door is flung open, and who the fuck opened it, but fucking chainsaw Jimmy. Gavin screams like a little bitch as Chainsaw Minnie revs up his chainsaw while laughing like a fucking lunatic. Meanwhile I pull out my fucking gun and shoot the little bitch right in the face. As if I'm going to a cabin in the middle of fucking nowhere without my gun. Chainsaw Ridley drops his fucking chainsaw and collapses to the ground. ", "Anyways, at this point Gavin is fucking ecstatic. He's calling me his hero and thanking me and shit. Fuck off Gavin, I don't give a fuck what you think about me. Anyways, I kick off Chainsaw Gimmy's mask, only to see my fucking girlfriends face under it. What the fuck Emily? I know you were two timing me with Trevor, but goddamn, that's no fucking reason to chainsaw massacre him and all his friends. ", "So since Emily killed everyone with a fucking chainsaw except me and Gavin I guess that killed the mood of the trip or whatever so Gavin insists we leave. This is the first fucking thing Gavin's said all this trip that makes any goddamned sense so I wholeheartedly agree. As we drive away from the cabin, I take out my GPS and start looking for nearby five star hotels.", "I saved the fuckers life, the least he can do is pay for an actually decent vacation.", "Edit: thanks for the gold", "\"What was that?\" asked Jen. Just as I opened my mouth the ask what it sounded like I saw a figure slowly turn away from the window  behind her. \"I think there's someone outside\" I replied. Visually shaken, she asked me if we should call the police. I responded with, \"well they could just be passing by let's see what happens.\" After a few minutes the figure appears again, this time at the window next to the television. She screams.", "Being a new relationship I know what I have to do. I get up, walk over to the window and lock eyes with the figure. It is wearing a blank mask with holes for the eyes, and mesh around the nose and mouth. It is so close, I can almost make out a perplexed expression on their face, surprised why I wasn't screaming or running out of the room. So I wave, and close the curtains. ", "At this point my girlfriend is petrified, with no color in her face. I calmly walk back to the couch, sit down and put my arm around her. \"Sh-sh-should we call the cops?\" she asked between shudders. \"Eh, if you want to go ahead... But for now let's just finish this episode\" I replied.", "She called the police, and they arrived in less than 4 minutes. We heard a knock, followed by \"STOP! HANDS UP! GET ON THE GROUND!\" Jen jumped up and ran to the window. \"They got him!\" she exclaimed. \"Cool,\" I replied without taking my eyes off the television. ", "A few minutes later one of the officers came to door to let us know they caught the tresspasser, making clear what they believed his intentions were. \n\"We caught this man jumping your fence as we arrived on scene. He had wire cutters, a large hunting knife, a semi automatic pistol, handcuffs, and rope.\" Jen gasped, realizing how close we were to becoming someone's play toys. The only think I could think of that I wanted to say was, \"great work, thanks for your time.\" And walked back to the living room. ", "Jen stormed in behind me and started with the yelling. \"I can't believe you aren't more grateful, they caught someone who wanted to kill us! Like in the horror movies!\" Which is where I replied, \"exactly, like the horror movies... Where the curious ones die first\"", "I sat down, grabbed the remote and pressed play. ", "This stupid fucking phrase rings through my mind almost hourly as I try to make it through the day. The reason it\u2019s in my head right now? It\u2019s pouring and a car just sped through a puddle, leaving me a wet mess. What\u2019s more, I dropped my phone when I got splashed, and now it won\u2019t turn on. ", " solution. ", " problem.", "The bus finally arrives and everyone rushes past me to escape the rain, leaving me the last one to get on. There\u2019s one place left to sit and it\u2019s right next to the nicest looking lady in the very back of the bus. Maybe my luck is changing?", "\u201cOh, dear!\u201d She exclaims at my appearance. \u201cHere honey, sit by the window, there\u2019s a little heater under the seat there. She gets up to let me in and a book falls from her lap. The front cover is torn off and there\u2019s handwriting covering all the margins in red ink. I try to read the printed text, but she snatches it up before I can focus my gaze on it. \u201cShakespeare,\u201d she says, blushing. \u201cAlways been a pain to read.\u201d", "I slide into the seat and put my backpack on my lap and rest my head against the window. I\u2019ve got a couple of hours until I change busses again, so I close my eyes and try to sleep, the heater blasting at the back of my legs from under the seat. It\u2019s almost painful, but I kind of like it. After a few minutes, the murmur of the bus becomes more faint and I begin slipping off to sleep.", "I wake up to a loud bang in complete darkness. I stand up and my legs brush against the bus seat. I let out a yelp and run my hand over my calves, which are hot to the touch. ", ".

I try anyway and hear a small pop followed by the smell of smoke. Great. I throw my phone on the seat and try to find my way to the front of the bus. When I make my way near the front, I hear a laugh from where I was sitting.", "\u201cHey!\u201d I yell. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking see. Do you have a light?\u201d", "The laughing turns to cackling and then to a deep growl. I can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s even coming from anymore. ", " I think. ", " The growling continues and I think I found the steps that lead off the bus. I finally exit the bus into a dark garage. \u201cHello?!\u201d I hear my own words echo back at me and the growling turns to a shriek. ", "I fumble forward until I run into something like a work bench. I run my hands across the top and cut my hand on something sharp. ", ". I wince in pain, but grab whatever it was by the handle to keep it close in case I need it. I keep running my hands across the top of the bench until I find something that feels like a pack of cigarettes. I open the lid and find a lighter inside.", "I don\u2019t know where I am or what\u2019s in this garage, but I need to see. I flick the lighter a few times until it stays lit and try to find a way out. The shrieking has stopped by this point and I can hear the pitter patter of feet coming towards me. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cWe can both leave together just don\u2019t trip over anything.\u201d", "Whoever is here is starting to laugh again. I shoot a dirty look in the direction of their laughter, even though I know they can\u2019t hear me. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re not gonna help, you can find your own way out.\u201d", "\u201cThere is no way out.\u201d", "Great, it\u2019s the lady from the bus. \u201cThen how the fuck did we get in here, lady?\u201d", "She starts cackling again. Whatever, I\u2019m going to keep looking for a way out.  The lighter doesn\u2019t help much, but I can see where I\u2019m stepping, at least. As I\u2019m focusing on my feet, my head slams into something and I fall to the ground. The lighter skips across the room and the sharp tool I found lands by my side. I grab it for safe keeping.", "The lady has stopped cackling, but I can hear her breaths and they get closer until she\u2019s finally over top of me. She starts speaking in Latin and I let out a little chuckle. This is just so typical. Well, not the Satanic hex or whatever - but my luck is typical.

My legs are still on fire from the damn heater. My hand is bleeding from where I cut myself. Now I\u2019m about to be fucking ", " Nope. I\u2019m in control.

Great.", "I'm standing in the middle of the woods, with just my pijamas on. ", "I have no idea how I got here. It's cold, I'm tired, and I just want to go to bed. The only problem is, that I live in the middle of a large city, in a place, where even the nights are warm and the air is soft.", "Here it's so cold, that my breath forms tiny clouds, and the air stings in my lungs.", "I must be far away then.", "I can't hear a sound. Not one. If we were near a city, I'd hear cars. \nBut that's not the strangest part. I can't even hear a bird, or the wind in the leaves.\nEverything is so quiet. It's actually kind of nice.", "Living in a large family, surrounded by a city that never sleeps, I actually never experienced silence. So I just close my eyes and ignore the cold.

Well, half of a face, as the man's left side is ripped right off, and the poor guy has a permanent half smile, due to the missing skin of his cheek.", "I was pretty confused, as I didn't hear the half smile guy's footsteps, so I wonder, if I went deaf, so I scream the loudest \"HELLO?\" I've ever screamed.", "I'm not deaf, although my voice doesn't echo.", "The misshapen man jumps and looks confused. \"Arren't you scared?\" He asked a in a slurrend manner, while I watched his saliva , not held back by his lips, spray in the moonlight.", "\"Why should I? It's pretty realxing, actually.\" I said, while stretching out my arm to give him a handshake. \"I'm Sasha\"", "The other half of his face started smiling too, and he looked genuenly happy.", "\"I'm Joe! I've been living here for the past 20 years, or maybe 40, who knows. People just randomly appear here, and I try to welcome them, but they always run away from me, for some strange kind of reason.

The sound of the church' clock was the only sound he could hear in the silence of the night.", "Ding. dong. ding. dong. ding. dong, and so on, all the way to twelve.", "Was it midnight already? He didn't know. He didn't care. Mom wouldn't be home before tomorrow, so Jake had the house for himself. And, more importantly, the computer.", "He was having fun, despite being the only person online on his Minecraft server.", "It was completely silent in the house. Painfully silent. Except for the occasional Minecraft sound coming from the computer. ", "\"Oh, balls..\" Jake wispered to himself. He really had to take a leak. The toilet wasn't that far away, but the room it was in was way too dark to see anything. The only source of light was coming from the computerscreen.", "\"Jake....\" He heard a feint voice whisper.\n\"Come and play..\"", "\"Ugh, boogers.. Mom's home early.\" He thought.", "As Jake looked up, expecting to see his mother, candles were lit up all around the room. Wait, this wasn't his house.. The light of the candles showed a huge red pentagram made of dark, thick blood on the ground. His desk, along with himself and the computer were in the middle of it.

Nobody had been taking care of the place for years.  \"Here we are, guys!\"", "Mary, Tabitha and Tom were all excited to go check out the abandoned cabin in the woods, but Richard wasn't feeling it.  \"Hey, look, can we not do this?  This is bad news, all around.\"", "Everyone sighed and groaned.  \"Oh, come on, Rich?  Don't be such a stick in the mud!\"  Tabitha was always so happy and bubbly.  It made Rich's teeth ache.", "\"No, guys, really.  This is a bad idea.\"  Things went back and forth for a few minutes, with Richard trying to be intelligent and reasonable, while everyone else cajoled, teased and semi-threatened to tell everyone how big of a scaredy-cat he was, back in school.  But they all seemed to miss Richard's increasing agitation.", "\"Look, you're a passenger, I'm the driver,\" David said in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.  \"I vote we go explore the cabin, you can stay out here in the spooky dark, all by yourself.\"  Mary made an 'Oh snap' face and covered her mouth, while Tabitha pouted.  \"Or you can walk home.\"  Tom laughed and gave David a mock punch in the arm and started to open the door to get out.", "Richard snapped.  There was a blur of movement, and a split second later, an ominous ", " of metal on metal, before a gleaming, chrome plated Colt M1911 appeared in Richard's hand, pressed to the back of David's head.  It took Mary, Tabitha and Tom a few seconds to figure out what had just happened, but despite his teenage stupidity, David knew that sound.  He and his dad shot guns all the time, and he knew that sound.", "The car erupted in chaos and screaming, the girls squeezing away from David and pressing against the door, or into Tom, who was fumbling for the door handle.  Tabitha was the loudest, babbling a non-stop stream of screaming Spanish and terrified prayers as she cowered against the far door in the back seat.", "David slowly took his hands off the wheel and held them in the air.  \"Okay.  Okay.  Calm down.  Everyone, stay calm.\"  He kept his voice low and steady, despite feeling an urgent need to pee.  He may have had a foolish desire to go explore the legendary Murder Cabin in the middle of the night, but having a powerful gun pressed to the back of your skull had the tendency to clear your thoughts and help you focus on the immediate moment.  David's calm voice helped soothe Tabitha's screaming, and Mary and Tom stopped fumbling with the door to wait and listen.", "Richard hadn't moved.  The weapon was firmly nuzzled deep into the hollow at the back of David's neck, right at the base of his skull.  Even if this were a BB gun, shooting him there might kill him.  \"We are leaving,\" he said softly.  As if to punctuate the statement, his thumb reached over and flipped the safety down with a sharp ", "  Tabitha whimpered and cowered deeper into the corner, her face a smeary mess of tear-striped mascara.", "David didn't want to nod with a gun in the back of his neck.  \"Right, got it,\" He slowly lowered his hands to the wheel and started the car.  \"I have to turn around to back up,\" he said.  \"Otherwise we might hit something.\"  Tabitha, Tom and Mary slowly slipped back into their regular seats, all three facing forward and shivering in fear.  They'd never seen this side of Richard before, and never wanted to see it again.", "Richard slowly drew the weapon back, and David slipped the gearshift into reverse, then slowly turned around to look out the back window. He glanced at Richard, who had a face of pure marble:  flat and emotionless.  His eyes were like dead mirrors in the dim light, a visage of complete lack of compassion or mercy; the epitome of pure, cold logic.  Giving a shudder, he focused out the back window and started to back up.", "The combination of backup lights and brake lights lit up the tangled mess of grass, shrubs, when he saw something.", "Not the eyes of any animal David knew, and he knew quite a lot, as he and his dad went hunting every year.  No, these were too high.  ", "  More importantly, they weren't side by side, like on a prey animal, but facing ", " like a predator.  He quirked his eyebrows and squinted, the hunter's instincts making him curious, rather than terrified the way it should.  \"What...\"", "The eyes moved.  They started coming towards the car.", "David's face went pale.  \"Oh, SHIT!\" he hissed, snapping out of his stare and slamming the shifter down into drive.  He stomped on the gas, making the powerful engine roar.  Tires spun and spit old gravel, clattering and pinging off the undercarriage, as the lumbering SUV careened forward and bounced around the weed-choked yard.", "Everyone got tossed around in the car, while David fought the wheel, foot still hammer down on the gas.  Tabitha screamed as she got thrown into Richard, who simply grabbed her and held her steady.  He was pointing the weapon at the roof, his trigger finger resting safely on the trigger guard.  But his face was still cold marble and expressionless.  \"Stay down,\" he told them.", "The vehicle bucked and jumped through the bumpy yard, tall weeds and thick brush snapping and clawing at the sides, screeching and clunking.  \"Road, road, road, where's the FUCKING ROAD!\"  Finally finding the original path they'd come in, he turned the wheels toward the way out.", "The back window shattered.  A horrific stench filled the cabin, and a low, guttural growl rumbled in the darkness.  Whatever it was, David couldn't see it in the rear view mirror.  It was big.  Big enough to block out the illumination of the brake and running lights.  ", "Big enough to hold the Chevy Suburban in place, tires spinning and spitting gravel.", "Tabitha had fallen into Richard's lap, where he held her down with one hand.  Out of all of them, he was the only one who'd worn his seat belt, and it was keeping him safely locked in place.  Tom and Mary were getting tossed, but the sound of breaking glass made them look.  Their horrified faces told Richard everything he needed to know.", "Calmly reaching over his shoulder, he began pumping rounds into whatever was back there.  The first shot made his ear ring.  The second made it hum.  The muzzle blast singed the hair on his neck and knocked off his hat.  He couldn't see what he was shooting at, so he relied instead on Tom and Mary.  So long as the look of terror remained on their faces, he knew he had to keep shooting.", "By the time the slide locked back in the empty position, the truck was moving again, Mary and Tom had stopped making horror faces, and Richard was totally deaf in one ear.  David raced down the road like a madman, while the others cowered and peered out the back, eyes darting back and forth as they searched the retreating darkness.", "\"David, slow down,\" he said.  \"You don't want to crash.  Not now.\"   David glanced in the rear view mirror, and Richard's face was badly burned from the muzzle blast.  And his ear was bleeding profusely.  He was probably going to be deaf for the rest of his life.", "\"What the fuck was that?\" he asked, turning his eyes back to the road and bringing it down to 50 on the speedometer.", "\"Don't know,\" he replied over the shuddering wind.  He laid a comforting hand on Tabitha, where she lay in his lap, shivering and weeping.  \"Don't care.\"", "\"I\u00c4! I\u00c4!\" the masked priest cried, lifting the sinuous dagger above his head. \"SHUB-NIGGURATH! THE BLACK GOAT OF THE THOUSAND YOUNG, COME TO FEAST!\"", "The woman next to Jon tried to scream through her gag as the knife plunged into her breast once, twice. Then she lay still, her eyes full of tears but slowly going dull.", "In the far distance, beyond curves of space and time unknown to man, there came a grunting and rumbling, as if formless beasts were somehow lumbering closer.", "Jon would have yawned, if his mouth had been free.", "\"Do you hear?\" the priest asked, leaning close to Jon. His eyes had the fevered gleam of mania in them. His scraggly beard tickled Jon's face as the priest leaned in even closer. \"Our Mother comes. She shall tonight feast upon the cooling corpse of your friend, as you watch. Then, in the most exquisite depths of your madness, she shall take from you the seed which shall birth a new race of abominations, who shall devour you, their progenitor, as their first act of unlife in this pitiful reality!\"", "Jon worked the gag in his mouth and loosened it to the point where he could say, muffled though, \"I don't know her.\"", "\"What's that?\" the priest asked, loosening the gag even more.", "\"I said, I don't know her.\"", "\"But... on the bridge... we took the two of you...\"", "Jon sighed. \"I was going to jump off the bridge and end my miserable life. I've got terminal brain cancer. Inoperable. My parents died last week in a car crash, and my father's girlfriend has a will that leaves everything to her. I'm broke. My girlfriend broke up with me because she can't deal with the cancer. I have no children. I hate my job. I hate my life. I have nothing to live for, and so I was just going to end it on my terms when that do-gooder you just sliced tried to talk me out of it. Your goons grabbed us as I was about to jump.\"", "\"So, er,\" the priest mumbled. \"You do not care if you die in horrible, maddening agony?\"", "\"I fucking welcome it, mate,\" Jon replied. \"You say that these spawn of your goat whore mother will devour the world, ending it in an apocalypse of flame and blood?\"", "\"Well, not in so many words. ", " is rather unclear on that point, but we take as an article of faith that the apocalypse will be...\"", "\"Fucking Christ, you're like cosmic Mormons,\" Jon muttered. \"Can you just fucking kill me, if you're going to prattle on about your fucked-up theology?\"", "\"Mock me, will you?\" the priest cried, standing back and flinging an arm out. \"Then behold! Shub-Niggurath approaches! Gaze into her thousand eyes and know true horror!\"", "\"It'll be remarkable to feel something, finally,\" Jon said, struggling against his bonds to turn and look at the horror out of darkness approaching him. Words could not describe it, for the qualities and properties of the earthly realms do not apply to the elder ones from beyond time and space. A maw opened, or perhaps it is more correct to saw, several maws stretching across infinite universes opened, and from them came a keening wail and the carrion stench of death's promise.", "\"At last,\" Jon breathed. \"Come on then, get to it.\"", "\"Do you not see her squamous bulk? Her gibbous, maddening form?\" the priest cackled. \"How can one mind endure?\" He ripped at his clothing and face with yellowed, cracked nails.", "\"Because,\" Jon said, closing his eyes. \"I don't give a fuuuuuuuuuck.\"", "It wasn't until the van door shut behind me that I realized my mistake. I guess the skin mask should have tipped me off.", "It's getting so you can't trust anyone anymore. ", "We drove for a long time. I felt the road getting rockier. By the time he opened the door it was dark out. ", "He yanked me out by the arm, hard. He knocked me to the ground. It was dirt. It smelled like something. Pennies. No, of course not. Blood. ", "Great. As if I didn't have enough on my plate today. ", "He laughed then, a low, insane laugh. He pointed an ax at my throat.", "\"Really? An ax? Don't you think that's a little derivative?\"", "\"You are not to speak,\" he said. \"But feel free to scream.\" (A little too theatrical for my taste, to be honest.)", "\"Look, this is a really bad time for me. I think we might have to table this for now.\" ", "\"I SAID YOU ARE NOT TO SP-\" ", "He fell to the ground. The look of surprise almost made it all worth it. Humans are so easy. ", "He couldn't move now, but he could still hear me and see me. He could still feel. They taste so much better when they're afraid. It really adds something. ", "I started at his feet. Crunching the little bones. His eyes stared straight up, but I felt his shock, his terror and pain. Far more used to being predator than prey. ", "I took my time. ", "This carnival was shit. The clowns looked stupid, the animals were boring, and even the food was awful. I don\u2019t like carnivals to begin with, even as a kid, but at least the food was always good. Hot and greasy, covered in sugar or butter. But this food was stale and rotten. Shit, just shit.", "When my boyfriend, Matt, asked if I wanted to go, I had said sure. I only said sure because I could see the childlike excitement. He was ridiculous sometimes, and I often thought of breaking up with him. The only reason I didn\u2019t would be because my mom would give me a hard time about being single. It was easier to put up with Matt being a little kid.", "So here we are at the carnival. Well here ", " am now. Matt disappeared a while ago, yelling something about conspiracies and death clowns. Something stupid. I told you he was stupid. I just waved my hand and took a sip from my pop. Even the pop was disgusting, all thick and syrupy with no carbonation. It had a salty sweet taste to it, and when I complained about it, the vendor just smiled widely and laughed. Laughed! In my face! I flipped them the bird and walked off. They didn\u2019t even include ice. ", "I wandered around, ignoring the grinning clowns with the worst make-up I had ever seen. They weren\u2019t even trying. Just a thick glob of red paint around their mouths and clinging to their teeth. Ugh, gross. ", "I walked into a tent labeled: ", ". ", "\u201cThis had better be good.\u201d I grumbled. It wasn\u2019t. Just more shit. The woman was sitting on a stool in the center of the tent with several grinning clowns surrounding her. She was pretty, but her hair was greasy and unkempt. She couldn\u2019t even wash her hair. Gross. The stool spun around and another face was revealed. It was shriveled and disgusting, a horrible paper mache mask. Its mouth opened and gave a moan.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll die here.\u201d The mask croaked. I rolled my eyes. Even the animatronics were shit. I turned around and left.", "A crowd of clowns were standing in front of the tent as I walked out, they\u2019re bad make-up annoying me. I pushed past them, shoving my almost empty cup of thick red pop into an overflowing trash can as I did.", "\u201cThis carnival sucks! Tell Matt to meet me at the car.\u201d I yelled as I walked out to my beat up old car, the only one in the dreary lot. This carnival was shit.", "Sighing, Frank removed the spit-covered barrel from his mouth and set the revolver carefully on his desk. He had been prepared for the end, even prayed for the first time in years, but had to look at the goddamned fishbowl before he pulled the trigger. Grumbling to himself, he stalked over to the barren pantry and looked in vain for one of those time-release feeders that he had bought for that vacation all those years ago. He had gone to Mexico on a cruise boat but felt awkward and out-of-place the whole time; he had talked to no one, only left the boat when forced to, and worn a t-shirt at all times, even when swimming. Still, Frank supposed, it was probably the happiest he had been since Marsha left him for that insurance adjuster, whatever-his-name-was. It was thoughts like that had strengthened his resolve to end it all in the first place. He found the fish food.\nAfter placing the little shell gently in the bowl and watching his court-ordered companion make a couple of laps around the tiny palm tree, Frank re-read the note. He was disappointed in its length, even after adding the typical \u201cit\u2019s not your fault\u201d and \u201cI wish you all the best\u201d kind of statements it barely filled half a page, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to add. As an afterthought, he found a pen and wrote in a P.S.", "\u201cIf I have been dead for more than 72 hours when I am found, please feed the fish.\u201d And an arrow in the general direction of the bookshelf upon which Tony\u2019s bowl sat. Pleased at his altruism, he sat back with a contented sigh and replaced the gun between his teeth. He once again thought of how nice it would be to be dead, without any bills or telemarketers or office parties, and once again said a little prayer, a bit of a \u2018just thought I\u2019d drop by\u2019 just to make sure that the Lord was still home, and switched the safety off. He gradually began to squeeze, tensed himself in preparation, and the phone rang.", "He groaned at the interruption, sometimes it seemed the universe was ganging up on you, really. He clenched his teeth and tried to ignore the ringer, but the obnoxious noise kept making him twitch, and he didn\u2019t want to miss and shoot his ear off or something. Switching the pistol to his left hand but keeping it firmly pressed into the roof of his mouth, he stood up awkwardly and waddled across the room, picking up the phone as drool began to run down his wrist. \n\u201cHe-ow?\u201d He asked around the barrel, moving it to the side of his mouth. If this was a telemarketer, he thought, they were in for the shock of their lives. There was no response, so he pushed the barrel farther against his cheek and tried to enunciate, \u201cHell-er?\u201d\nOn the other end of the phone, there was still no response, just the sound of heavy breathing. Frank started to put the phone down, prank callers were usually teenagers, and he didn\u2019t want to scar one by forcing them to witness a suicide. As he was about to hang up, a distorted voice rang out from the other end.", "\u201cFrank Storrs?\u201d Whoever it was, Frank didn\u2019t recognize them; they had a deep, garbled voice, and sounded American, \u201cI\u2019m coming for you, Frank Storrs.\u201d Then a click as whoever it was hung up.", "\u201cOh goddammit. Can I not get one single thing done?\u201d Frank cursed at the heavens. He pulled a mostly-clean paper towel from the wastepaper basket and wiped down the slimy pistol. Probably some solicitor, the security-system guys had gotten awfully pushy lately, but almost certainly someone who Frank wouldn\u2019t want to encounter as he killed himself. He grabbed the last granola bar from the pantry and ate it slowly, waiting for the door.", "He didn\u2019t have to wait long, it turned out. In a matter of minutes, there was a knock. As he opened it, he felt a strong hand on his neck, and a rag was forced over his mouth and nose. Rolling his eyes at the sheer inconvenience of it all, Frank fell unconscious. ", "When he awoke, he was in a basement, tied to one of his own cheap kitchen chairs. He stared at a man in a Ronald-MacDonald mask who leveled a small pistol at his head.", "\u201cWould you mind using mine?\u201d Frank asked, \u201cI hate to be a bother, but I\u2019ve just put an awful lot of research into this, and it really is best done with a large caliber, solid point-\u201d The gun was brought level to Frank\u2019s eye line and he sputtered, \u201cno, no, you see what you\u2019re doing there? You\u2019re more likely to break your own wrist, holding it like that. Here, let me show you\u201d Frank went to take the gun, but found his hands still bound to the chair arm. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d He shook the arm a bit to indicate what he wanted. ", "It should not be possible for a plasticine Ronald MacDonald mask to look perplexed, but somehow this one managed. The killer seemed to think warily for a moment, and looked around the room carefully for any hidden traps or tricks before untying Frank\u2019s left arm with a slight \u2018what-could-go-wrong\u2019 shrug. ", "\u201cRight, now I\u2019ll be needing my gun.\u201d Frank said matter-of-factly. Ronald MacDonald flinched, stepping backwards and brandishing his own weapon, but Frank remained unmoved. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, I\u2019d rather you did it right. Now, I have clearly put more thought into this sort of thing so the sooner you hand me my pistol, the sooner we can both get what we want.\u201d The killer hesitated but soon obeyed, getting the revolver from a drawer and handing it to his captive, who examined it with no small amount of pride. \u201cYes\u201d Frank said, \u201cthis is the weapon that you want. You feel the heft of that? It\u2019s difficult to get first-hand reviews of suicide implements, for reasons that I hope are self-explanatory, but I managed to research this quite a bit. It\u2019s the large caliber that\u2019s the thing, you see, You want one that\u2019s a big enough bore to kill you, of course, but a small enough one that the exit wound will still allow for an open casket. Speaking of which, the ideal trajectory in this case would cast the bullet out somewhere between the base of the skull and the spine, so if you wouldn\u2019t mind getting on one knee, I\u2019ll hand you the gun back and we can see if we can\u2019t do this thing for real.\u201d", "Frank continued to direct the killer for quite some time, he really was quite poor at taking directions, and the gun passed between the many a time as Frank walked the man through what would likely happen, how to avoid getting any spray on his nice white shirt, etc. Angle was adjusted, and position, then the bullet checked in the chamber, it had to be in the slot on the right side of the chamber (no, your other right, thank you so much). While Frank held the gun as to let the killer stretch his mask\u2019s eyeholes just a touch wider, a strange thought passed through the captive, and he carefully shot the would-be-murderer in the head. ", "As blood poured smoothly out onto the floor, Frank smiled at the neatness of his shot. Muttering about something about doing things oneself, he put the gun back in his mouth and pulled the trigger, now prepared to meet his fate.", "Click. Click. Clickclickclickclick. \u201cGoddammit.\u201d That had been the only bullet left in the house, too. Frank would have to go buy more. But he was out of money, now, he had given it away in what were supposed to be his last days. That meant he\u2019d have to go back to work for a day or two, at least until his next paycheck came in. Which meant he\u2019d now have to deal with the man he\u2019d just shot. Frank untied his still-bound arm and legs and removed the time-release feeder from Tony\u2019s tank, putting his pistol back in its drawer. ", "Well, this is just perfect, isn't it?", "The only hotel in the area, and it isn't on TripAdvisor. Damn it. I guess it'll have to do. Probably some cheap motel, or something like that.", "Hey, this is actually really nice. A big Gothic mansion, with some ancient dead trees out in front. Those black flowers look.. meh, but it's surprisingly fine.", "Okay. Floors are creaky, the old man in charge is creepy, and I think that's a black widow. I really don't care, this is the only place I can stay.", "Damn it. Woke up in the middle of the night, have to use the bathroom, because my room doesn't come with an en-suite. The entire house is like a maze in the dark, I could swear the floor plan wasn't this confusing in the evening.", "Hey! Light! Torches for mood lighting! Bathroom...satanic ritual. Alright, they can do their thing, and I'll do my thing. Wait, are those sacrifices? I'll have to call the cops when I get somewhere with cell phone reception.", "Wait, is someone following me? Probably just my eyes seeing things, the moonlight shining through the cracks isn't bright enough for me to make out what's in front of me. Hey, it's that one guy I saw briefly on my way in! He's sleeping... in the hallway... in a puddle of something... and it almost looks like he is missing his brain and the back of his head. Probably just a trick of the light. H's probably drunk, and that dark stuff on the floor is probably whisky, or vomit.", "Is that the owner? Why is he wandering the halls at 3 am? Did he just walk through that wall? Honestly, I'm too tired to care. I still haven't found an open bathroom, the last one looked like someone had committed suicide in it.", "Oh, a bathroom! The light are even on, if flickering. Okay, wash my hands... is there someone behind me? Sorry, I just finished up here, just need to rinse... and done!", "Huh. Could have sworn there was someone in the mirror behind me. Oh well, I just want to go back to bed.", "Okay... found the reception. Someone seems to have boarded up the front door from the outside, probably because someone broke the glass and completely wrecked the area. It looks like it's been abandoned for the past hundred years, that's how badly wrecked everything is.", "Why am I here, anyway? I don't remember going down any staircases... Doesn't matter. I remember my way from here.", "Alright... now someone went and redecorated my room. Hope they didn't touch my stuff. I'm just too tired to care. It's 4 am. Guess I'm sleeping surrounded by claws tonight. Bye!", "Years ago, when visiting a \"haunted\" house in the oldest neighborhood in the city, Dave had first felt what he now referred to as \"The Pressure\". It was a sense of dread, a prickling of the hairs on the back of the neck. Every sense in his body would key up, warning him that Something was coming, and it wasn't friendly. ", "After nearly a decade of this, it wasn't quite so exciting. Dave was currently nestled into the thick cushions of a disturbingly Gothic couch, the dark oak twisting and writhing in near-impossible curves around obscenely plush purple velvet pillows. ", "Dave could still hear Jennifer and Mark in the other room, noisily having sex on an equally Gothic four-poster bed. He had a certain grudging admiration for their ability to make the bed, which had to weigh several hundred pounds, occasionally jump and hit the wall. He wasn't really that surprised when he felt The Pressure earlier in the evening; an isolated cabin, offered out of the blue by an unknown relative, with furniture so ornate that Dracula himself might say it was a bit much? Dave rolled his eyes just thinking about it again. ", "He had a pretty good feel for how this would go, after experiencing it so many times. The FBI had basically given up trying to address the problem, and simply had a unit on standby for cleanup. They tried putting him in prison once; at least they could explain that one as a prison riot. Dave began ticking off on his fingers, curious if he could get the exact moment correct this time. He lowered one finger at a time as he mouthed the numbers silently. Six, five, four, th-", "The familiar sound of steel slicing into flesh, followed by a scream of agony from Jennifer and a (oddly) equally girly scream from Mark interrupted his counting. Dave frowned; maybe next time. The squelching noises cut off, and the sawing and hacking began. Jennifer's screams finally cut off, and Mark sprinted through the doorway, his eyes wide with terror, blood streaming down his chest. He screamed something unintelligible at Dave and continued running. ", "Dave sighed; time to get up and move on. Shame really, this couch was absurdly comfortable. He tried to sit up and found himself completely enveloped in the couch, the soft velvet not giving him enough purchase to actually get out of the damn thing. Whatever had chopped up Jennifer slowly glided past the couch, wearing her flayed face and hands. Gee, Dave thought, I've only seen that trick about a hundred times; this one wasn't going to be interesting, he could tell already. The fellow with the spiked body armor, now THAT had been interesting. Dave tried reaching out to the arms but they were just a hair too far away for him to get a good grip.", "More screams followed down the hall as Dave continued trying to get out of the couch. He flailed around furiously, making some progress, but as soon as he stopped he sank even deeper into the cushions. He glowered at the couch, and decided he needed a new plan of attack. Mark had apparently gone outside, since his head came crashing through the front-facing window of the living room and rolled to a stop in front of the couch, his face still locked in an expression of horrified surprise. Dave twisted his body and tried rolling off the couch; success! With a loud \"thump\" he rolled off the couch and hit the floor, knocking Mark's head down the hallway. Dave swore and massaged his banged-up knees a bit before standing up and brushing himself off. ", "A loud crash informed him that something had entered the upstairs of the cabin, probably through the conveniently large plate-glass window. More screaming followed, as a background to the slicing and hacking. A drop of red appeared on Dave's arm, followed by another, and another. The pace increased until it was raining blood in the living room, a crimson downpour complete with waves of red oozing down the walls. Dave sighed. The dry-cleaning bill for these was always a bitch. ", "Dave ambled out of the house, reasoning that there was no reason to rush since he was already soaked, and gently closed the door behind him. He triggered the FBI contact fob and tossed it onto the porch; the cleanup crew would be around later. He yawned, and idly wondered if that furniture store down the street could find him something similar to that couch...", "\"So,\" the interviewer said, manicured hands folded neatly in her lap.  \"How did you end up living in the Cardvale Murder House?\" \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Well, my husband Jason sells real estate for a living,\" Sarah explained, still squinting and blinking at the earliness of the hour.  She wore pink yoga pants and a cheery yellow tank top under a wooly gray cardigan.  \"And I work from home selling my bespoke leather accessories on Etsy.  He was trying to sell this gorgeous early colonial and just nobody would buy it.  It's in such great shape.  It's even got these quirky authentic coved ceilings.\"  She gestured to the curved corners in the plaster ceiling, then held out her hand to her right.  The interviewer twitched, blond curls swaying, as a tiny, pale hand emerged from behind a curtain to place a cup of steaming coffee in Sarah's hand.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Thanks, Priscilla.  So he kept coming back with client after client and just nobody would bite, even at the crazy low price the seller was offering.  It's not like it was built on a Native American Burial ground.  That would be stupid - hang on, it's 9:00.\"  She paused as every chair in the house suddenly slid two inches backward, then forward again.  The camera bobbed with the operator's startlement and the interviewer shrieked, clinging to hers with both hands, but her weight hand no impact on the force of the chair's movement.  \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Sorry about that,\" Sarah said.  \"That's the father, Hiram.  He has a thing about chairs.  We think it's because he hanged himself by kicking one over?  Either that or it's because he used to be a carpenter.  We can't even buy new dining chairs because he breaks them.  It has to be a pile of raw lumber in the outbuilding left overnight and he just builds new ones.  So that's a big perk.  They're really solidly built. If we can get a medium in here again next week we're going to ask him about selling some of them online.\"\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Didn't he kill his entire family?\" the interviewer says breathlessly, holding tightly with both hands to the front of her skirt.  The camera bobs again slightly as the cameraman nods.  \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Now everyone seems to think that, but we actually think the others probably died of natural causes, like pneumonia or cholera or something,\" Sarah said, gesturing with her free hand.  Her energy seemed to increase slightly as she drank more coffee.  \"They really don't seem angry at him.  He and Lula walk across the grounds every night at around ten, hand in hand.  So whatever happened, there's obviously no hard feelings.\" \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"What about the children?\" the interviewer asked.  \"Aren't they often sighted covered in blood?\"\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Oh, you mean little Robert.  He scared a lot of people off during the viewings, I can tell you, but once we got him a ball to play with he just wasn't any trouble at all - in fact, there he goes.  Of course he's not fully visible in daylight.  He's shyer than Priscilla.\" \u00a0", "\u00a0", "There was a sound of running footsteps, and the interviewer turned to look as Sarah pointed into the vestibule past the elegantly furnished living room.  A colorful striped ball bounced slowly past, attended by the sound of tiny pattering feet. \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Anyway, that's a family in-joke.  Apparently he ran under a pig Hiram was butchering once and just got soaked, and they all thought it was so funny he never let go of it,\" Sarah said.  \"It's kind of gross to me, but you know how little boys are.  We think he'll be good company if we have a boy.  We're trying to start a family.\" \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"You're going to try and raise children here?\" the interviewer said, blinking in startlement. \u00a0", "\u00a0", "\"Well sure.  It's the safest place you can possibly imagine,\" Sarah said happily.  \"Hey, Priscilla, I could use some more coffee if you're not busy.\"  She held out the delicate porcelain cup, which gently faded from view.  \"A burglar tried to get in here once and we only knew it because we found one shoe and a pair of pants he lost trying to get back out the window.  He didn't take a single thing with him.  Hiram kept moving the chairs around all day that day.

The demon stepped slowly into the kitchen through the door from the living room, tendrils of shadow seeping off of it and gripping the door frame like tentacles . Where its feet touched the ground, holes were burned in the floor that slowly began to close up behind it as if they were never there.

I can hear her screaming all the way down. Good. ", "Stephanie begs for us to keep going but I know better. We are being herded, and it's time to fight back. I tell her she can run if she wants but I am going to ambush our new friends at the narrowest part. Stephanie leaves, 'good luck' I say to no one.

I follow the trail down and walk to where boy 1 and 2 died and I strip them of their clothes, supplies and weapons. Boy 2's bow should come in handy. Its near midnight and I'm exhausted.

They are sloppy, leaving their tracks everywhere. I start hunting them. They fucked w the wrong man.

The result was rather picturesque as I could see the green fields, forest, and setting sun through a winter medium. The beauty of this contradiction was dazzling. ", "After the frost, my bedroom door would creak open and they would stand outside in the hallway, silently staring at me with their malevolent red eyes until the fading rays of the sun had completely exited the room. Then, they would shuffle in, one-by-one until they had surrounded my bed. Still staring, still silent. ", "When there wasn't enough room around my bed, the rest would crawl on the wall above my head or look at me from the ceiling, their heads grotesquely turned upside down. Red eyes. Still staring. Still silent. ", "When the sunset gave way to complete darkness, they would start murmuring. They would talk about hell and the pain that could not even be described. They would sometimes brush their fingertips along my face and I would be paralyzed with the pain that emanated from this whisper of a touch. They would tell me that as bad as hell is, that pain was for the future and that I would feel enough pain for a lifetime in the immediate when they decide its finally time to kill me. They would tear me apart, slowly and methodically, so that my mortal pain could be prolonged. ", "I didn't care about hell or the pain that came with it. I think they knew that so they tried to force me to be scared by telling me during these nightly rituals. They knew why I wasn't scared and why I didn't care at all what happened to me or where I ended up. They knew what really hurt me but they were forbidden from uttering the names of my wife and daughter. ", "It was my fault they were dead. \"They\" being the demons and my wife and daughter. I caused the wreck and I'd been the only one to survive if that's what you called what I was doing. My only consolation was that my wife and daughter had gone to heaven. I had no place there anymore.

While... Whatever, it won't matter in a few moments.\" The thought crept through Richard's mind just as he got over Dean's shoulder.

These people will absolutely follow a good leader over just another guy, but if you can prove that you\u2019ve got the Big Man\u2019s blessing, you\u2019re in.

Why would you come back if the meatsuit was all that limited your path for world peace? Not that I even understand the connection there...\"\n\"Well, people just seem to limit others based on the biological package they are born into. I decided why not just eliminate the flesh, be rid of the limitation and be totally free? But freedom did not come. There were greater forces at play than simply the confinement of flesh.

They were fun and a nice escape for me. I picked up quite a few different outfits. Joined in with the crowd getting into character, playing along like this was all accurate for the time period. But now the time had come to really experience what that time was like. I had everything I needed. My renfair outfit was perfect. Nothing to high class looking. I wanted to blend in. I didn\u2019t have any aspirations of going back and becoming a king, conquering the world, or anything like that. I just want to look around for a bit. Get the lay of the land so to speak.

I never understood it, water had no taste and I had no taste for it, yet everyone was sure tat I wanted it and needed it.

We all walk the earth aimlessly and alone, avoiding each other for the fear that upon confrontation one of us would be forced to drink water, to concede death, just to prove they're different. I don't say this as hyperbole. I say this as fact. I say this as the last air bubble surfaced the glass of water in front of me, almost reflecting the spiteful glare from the stranger I had just met. I'd love to embellish and say that that glass of water tasted of pride as I swallowed it, but the truth of the matter is, it didn't taste like anything, it was still just water.

It messes them up. It's worse than slapping them around, or telling them every day that they're garbage. They say that if you neglect your child, they'll develop all sorts of disabilities, learning, physical, social - you name it. If the neglect is severe enough, they'll never learn to walk or talk. Oftentimes, a neglected child ends up in an early grave. ", "You can't ignore your kid, and especially not if that kid has only just been catapulted into life. A newborn baby is entirely dependent upon it's caregiver for sustenance. Can you imagine - a little pathetic sack of fat and skin and bone being able to maintain it's own flickering, barely-there life force? Impossible, you'd say! The rest of the world would agree. However, not many have heard the tale of little Albert, born in the freshly founded colonies to the most neglectful mother of all, a woman named Mary Molson who would have tossed her infant son in the river the moment he slipped free from her womb and stumbled blindly into her care, should her family and neighbors allow it. ", "There were only forty-four men in the colony, and one of them was surely little Albert's father, except none would step into the name. If Mary Molson knew his face or name, she wouldn't say, perhaps out of fear that a marriage would naturally ensue. So she spent nine months pregnant, and gave birth in the corner of her shabby home without assistance. Once the grueling process was finished, she rinsed off the mess from her hands, her legs, and finally her son. She left him in crudely constructed bassinet (a gift from the colony's founder - it was, after all, the first english baby born in the lower americas) and left Albert to himself. ", "Over the next few weeks, the colonists came in to coo over little Albert's bassinet and offer their half-hearted congratulations to Mary Molson. It wasn't long before the visitations stopped, as little Albert grew into his reputation as an ill-tempered child. His cries could always be heard, and as much as the colonists tried to help, nothing seemed to stop his tears. \"Is he tired?\" they'd ask, \"...or hungry maybe?\" Mary Molson would wave away their suggestions and say, \"Are you kidding? All he does is sleep and eat.\" Though, not once did anyone see little Albert doing either. ", "Over time, little Albert gave up on crying. He spent his days and nights staring, wide-eyed and without expression at the sides of his bassinet. The fat layer coating his body slipped away to reveal the fragile bones beneath it. His lips became cracked, and discolored. Dark circles formed under his eyes. After a few months, his pinkish glow was gone and his skin began to shrivel up on itself. Little Albert was only just beginning his life, but his skin sagged and folded like he was a hundred years old. ", "You may be wondering: how on earth did little Albert survive for all this time? Never sleeping? Never eating? Surely after three months of this torment, he would have turned to bone and ash! But that's just the thing: little Albert didn't die. He never did. Over the years, he continued on, quite normally in fact. He never ate, or drank, or slept. He simply...existed, just as he was born. Frozen in a state of complete independence. ", "Albert isn't little anymore. He grew into a new, adult-sized body just like you'd expect of anyone else. If you saw him, you'd surely say, \"Why that man looks a thousand years old!\" You'd be right, or nearly so. Today, April 18th in the year 2624, Albert has turned nine-hundred. His face is sunken in, his skin is papery thin, and his voice rasps out like radio static. Each word falls out of his mouth slowly, past a crusted, powdery tongue, tripping down the long-dried up riverbed. Not once has a drop of water graced the surface of that tongue. If you asked for the secret to his longevity, Albert would happily supply it for you.", "\"How have I lived this long?\" he'd say, an amused smile tearing the corners of his mouth. ", "\"I'll tell you first humanity's greatest mistake. At some point in our history we compared ourselves, in all our rational wit and beautiful, never-ending creativity to the beast. We saw savage creatures pursuing pitiful pleasures like food and water, and we decided that was a fit venture for us, too. Our greatest mistake was assuming that our mouths were intended for anything other than language. Beasts drink. They eat, they drink, they pleasure themselves or each other with their disgusting, sloppy mouths. They intake the poison, again and again until it kills them. Humans were never meant for such perversion. We can live forever, so long as we refuse the temptations of the beast.\"", "\"The poison. It's in everything. If anything touches your tongue, you have been exposed to it, and it takes it's hold. At first it's diluted. They get it only in tiny increments. Then the addiction sets in, and they're tied to it. They have to drink or they lose their minds. They'll scream for it! Endlessly, screaming! Then, it's not long until they start drinking the poison straight. Look at the masses! They do it hundreds of times a day, constantly swigging away at bottles, canteens, cups, and glasses, moving faster and faster toward their own death! They start consuming it in all forms. They become lost to the addiction. At that point, there's nothing that can be done. If they stop, the withdrawal effects of the poison will surely kill them, even sooner than it would otherwise. Hope is lost. They're locked into their own impending doom.\"", "\"A cure? Sure, it can be avoided. Look at me! I'm nine-hundred years old. The temptation to drink doesn't even reach me anymore. If I die, it will be alongside the rest of humanity. Until then, I will continue on. Even as entire generations drop dead around me.\"", "\"For you? No, my friend. I'm afraid there's no hope. You can blame your caregiver for that. They committed you to the poison before you could even lift your own head up. You were completely subject to their will, a clueless infant, unable to act on your own, and now, their ignorance has determined your fate. Look at you. Your smooth skin, your plump features...God I mourn for you, friend. You wear the face of human depravity.\"", "\"Dude you've got to meet this guy. He looks so... different but speaks so wise. Have you seen \"The Man from Earth\" where the guy is immortal, it's almost like he is that guy.\" said John to Misty, switching on the air conditioner and standing in front of it.", "\"What's his secret? LSD?\" said Misty slyly almost mocking. She removed her clothes and started fanning herself with it.", "\"Well I don't know, his face is almost like contours in a mountain and his voice crackles when he speaks, but if you hear it, wisdom falls like waterfall\" said John, finally sitting down with relief. He picks up a newspaper and an article reads \"Finally proven 100% of people who drink water will die.\" He chuckles.

It's an empty room. The only item that I carry is my mind. ", "They come to the room, having taken an appointment. These types of meetings are my only source of income. They look puzzled and distracted upon seeing my room, nothing new. I look at her bag's side pocket to see if she brought a water bottle. She did, but it was empty.  ", "\"Before you ask, my room is empty because there is no need for material things to surround me with as I surround myself with the genius inside me. With silence. A silence that speaks volumes of knowledge, wisdom and wit. I don't go out because there is nothing that your world can teach me as it is rotten now. I look weak but I can kill you in 3 seconds barely so don't try. And no I won't tell you the secret to my immortality.\"", "John and Misty were shocked.

Do we torture him?\"  A voice asked the leader.", "\"I didn't sign up for that.\"  Another voice scolded back.", "\"I guess we'll let him go.\"  The leader finally said.  \"This has been the most disappointing culmination of a cult's grand prophecy I've ever heard of.\" ", "She told me to 'keep my eyes pealed' and hung up.

Although barbaric in origin, Bo agreed to the task.", "Bo jumped a little as someone had finally answered the door, the assumed target. He was certainly a sight to see. He had a terrible slouch and time had shrunken him to the size of a small sand worm. His skin sagged and dragged on the ground from his body, but his face was probably the most peculiar. His eyes were complete black and mostly hidden by a hard squint. His wrinkles made his face look like the texture of stone. He beckoned Bo into his domain. Bo took his hand off his weapon, he wanted to see where this went.", "Careful not to step on the little man, Bo found a comfortable place to stand.

", "\"If your in need of directions I'm afraid I can't help with that,\" The old man said, \"Once the storms had rolled in I have never left my home, I too am unaccustomed to the land.\" Bo's jaw almost dropped but he kept an understanding face. The Watcher informed him this man was older than what was thought humanly possible but if he lived through the storms of legend he was far past 500 years old. Sort of creeped out Bo unbuckled his canteen from his belt. While he promised he wouldn't drink until Thursday he drank anyways. The old man stopped rocking in his chair, his face grew serious. ", "\"What are you drinking there young man?\" The old man asked desparately. Bo stopped drinking and licked his lips. If Bo told the truth he might put himself in possible danger. The liquid was a precious resource throughout the land and this man looked mighty thirsty. ", "\"W-water...\" Bo said impulsively. The old man quickly waddled up and snatched the canteen from Bo's dry hands. ", "\"No...\" The old man breathed in disbelief, \"surely there's no more...\" His hands quivered in temptation but he shoved the canteen back into Bo. \"Get that away from me,\" The old man demanded. Bo did as he was told.", "\"How long have you been drinking water?\" The old man asked.", "\"For as long as I can remember, sparingly.\" Bo answered the old man.

He waddled over to a gagdet of his own creation, mixing sand and his own hair within it. As he turned a crank he glanced at Bo.", "\"How much did they pay you?\" The old man asked calmly. Bo stepped back, surely he wasn't talking about The Watcher and Bo's task, right? \"While physically I am weak, age has made my mind sharper than ever,\" The old man added.", "\"A few more gallons of water, that's what they're going to pay me,\" Bo gulped. He returned his hand to his weapon. The old man finished his mixture and poured into into another gadget, transporting that into the sunlight through a window.

Believe me when I say there's something past the desert, there nature is not the destructive force you think it is.\" The old man turns back to the window, \"age has prevented me from traveling or I would have left this wasteland.\" Finally the old man beckons Bo to leave and continues staring out the window.", "Bo, for some reason he can not explain, shrugs off his task and exits the home. He glances back at the old man's hut. At first he thought the old man's words were nothing but drops of insanity but a feeling deep inside believed every word.

Well, it wasn't must mine - a few other young men and women were born twenty-one years ago today.  We had that in common, along with the creeping dread about our titles.  ", "Every person, upon turning twenty-one, was granted a title.  It was supposed to reflect the greatest accomplishment of your youth - to give you something to reflect on as you grew, and a bar to exceed as you built a life.  It was a tradition left over from a very long time ago, when we considered people adults at thirteen, and twenty-one was something like middle age.  As the world got more complicated, and safer as well, the twenty-one year old villagers were barely adults.  We'd had precious little chance to accomplish anything, and the titles were becoming something else - even shameful, in some cases.  ", "I watched as the line moved forward.  The Oracle, Glenda:Devourer of Fifty-Three-Chicken-Nuggets-In-A-Single-Sitting, took each youth by the hands, and stared into their eyes.

All who were older had stood there fearing something similar, and all who were younger feared it for themselves.

No one would jeer a strange, or pathetic title, but many would congratulate a commendable one. ", "The saddest case was right in front of me.  Alan.  Poor Alan, who had the worst luck.  I don't just mean the title - I mean his life, which led up to his title, \"Alan:Survivor-Against-Long-Odds\".  If anything bad could happen, it happened to Alan.  The illnesses, the accidents.  Which were almost as bad as the 'accidents'.  His parents had been real angels (before they'd had an accident of their own, and gone there), but not the kind you'd find in Heaven.  Things had gotten better for Alan after that, and he'd gone to live with his Aunt.  He had fewer bruises and 'fell down' far less often these days, but he still tended to flinch at a loud noise.

Yes, I suppose.\"", "\"Which were sweet, which were colourful... Even which were dangerous, poisonous?\"", "\"Yes, in fact,\" said Henry, some of the confidence returning. This was his area of expertise, after all. \"The Hudleys you have to avoid the most.

She had been bored out of her mind, trying to figure out what appeal the shiny rocks locked behind the glass case had. Or at least she was, until the saleswoman called her mom something she'd never heard before. Bea, Winner of Pageants.", "\"What are pageants?\" She'd asked her mom in the car on the way home. Beatrice's eyes glimmered in the rearview mirror, hopeful that her daughter would follow her passions.", "\"Well,\" she began, and told Lily about her biggest achievement the entire ride home.", "When Lily learned about the naming ceremony at school, she thought back to that moment. She had inherited her father's crooked nose and clumsiness, and her biggest talent was probably the kazoo. There was no way she could be Lily, Winner of Pageants. From that moment forward, she set her sights on doing something so amazing that it would stay with her forever. Something like Lily, Curer of Cancer, or Lily, Discoverer of New Planet Capable of Sustaining Human Life.", "And now, just days away from her naming ceremony, she felt like she had done it. At sixteen, she'd already had a Masters Degree in Neurobiology. By nineteen, she had two Ph.D.'s and had found a cure for AIDS. In the past year, she'd been successful in talking two countries down from nuclear annihilation while breaking barriers in the technological field. Surely Glenda would have enough to choose from.", "But the day of Lily's twenty first birthday was different. People from all over the world had flocked to her city to try to get a glimpse of the most highly achieved person receiving a fitting title. The world's biggest news channels had set up their cameras, focused on the stage where she'd be named Bringer of Peace, or something of that caliber. Her mom said it would be the biggest televised event in history, and insisted that Lily dress up. She'd begrudgingly agreed.", "So there she was, sitting in a plush chair with a glittering navy gown on. Her face looked like it had been dipped in gold thanks to her mother's expert, albeit aging, hands. She waited patiently as her peers were called up on stage, given titles like Winner of Pettiest Catfight and Conqueror of Important Track Meet. Lily ran through her long and impressive resume in her head, wondering which of her achievements Glenda would choose to baptize her with.", "\"Lily\". A voice boomed. Instantly, there was a bustle from the camera crews hired to get live coverage of the event. The entire city began to murmur excitedly as she walked up to Glenda, eager to get her title. This was it, the moment she'd been working towards her entire life.", "She stood in the spotlight of one hundred cameras and billions of pairs of eyes staring at her. There were murmurs again, but this time, they were softer, more subdued. Almost like gasps.", "\"A list of achievements most impressive.\" Glenda said, her voice rattling the stage. \"But the most recent is the one for you.\"", "Lily thought about her achievements, smiling to herself when she realized what it would be. Lily, Rescuer of Aboriginal Village. ", "Glenda smiled as well. The entire world, watching from each and every corner, smiled as well.", "\"Lily.\"", "\"Receiver of Most Public Attention For Her Beauty.\"", "I kissed my mother goodbye, as I headed off to begin the trek that would surely mark the end of my life. She was trying, and failing, not to cry. So was I. We lived a mile away from town because of her 'gifts', close enough to be within reach, far enough away to keep seperate from the'decent folk'. \"She lived\", I mentally corrected, there was no way I would be allowed to return. I pondered what would happen to her briefly, then I shook myself of it, sure she could heal, even bringing people back from their deathbed, but there would always be those, like on THAT night. I turned away, unable to bear the thought a moment longer I shouldered my bag with the day's provisions, and strode off trying to ignore Mother's strangled sob. As I walked I briefly considered her name, and the horror story that she told me was her titling day. Miranda, Summoner of the Spirits, she told me it was an accident, she had been apprenticed to the bookseller and she had peeked in a book she ought not have and next thing she knew she had passed out on the floor, it wasn't for another five years on her titling day that anyone had realized that she housed a spirit of healing. Despite it's purity and usefulness, she was cast out as a witch, even through she was engaged to and pregnant by the mayor's son. One day we had hoped to move to a castle city, where 'gifted' people were welcome, but that's the funny thing about poverty. No one cares what money you could make, only what you had. It was about noon when I stopped to eat my lunch and take a swig of water before moving on, I was nearing the edge of the village. I wondered briefly what they would have done if I had not presented myself, probably brought the old coot to my, although it wasn't really necessarily required that my prescence be there for her to announce my title, I really didn't want them to send soldiers out to my mother's hut and put her at risk. I was at the door now. I took my last breath of pure, clean, free fresh air, and stepped inside. Glenda, Devourer of 53 Chicken Nuggets in One Sitting, was hunched over asleep. I prodded her cautiously. She sprang up, grabbed my face and looked into my eyes. I was reliving THAT night. A man. The smell of alcohol. The door swinging in the wind. Me, running in. Him, over my mother. Her blacked eye. I saw red. Then everything faded, I was looking at Glenda, the crazy old coot, as she wrote my title down in the pages of the registry. I saw her lips move and I ran out of the building, down the streets. I reached the hut by nightfall, I've never run so fast. I burst in, Mother was at the table. \"Micah...\", I gasped inbetween gulps of air, \"Micah..... Bringer of Justice\".

This title was gonna stay with me for as long as I lived. I'm mundane as shit. What good do I have? I'm not gonna have any awesome title. The guy in front of me, he was the lead guitarist for a band, I think. Aaron, lead guitarist of a shitty grunge band, that's a better title than whatever I'm gonna get. Maybe they'll call me \"Bryan, the sad crier in a bathroom cubicle\" or something. ", "There are only 2 people left in the line. Me and this guy, Aaron. At least I'll have compa...

Glenda says hi, offers you a biscuit, gives you your title, you piss off. How hard could it be? I just-", "\"Holy shit that was fast\", says Aaron.", "\"Wait. WHAT?! HOW ARE YOU ALREADY OUT?\"", "\"Easy lmao. She said hi, gave me a biscuit, told me my title, I pissed off.\"", "I swear if I didn't know him I'd call him a smartass. It looked like it's my turn. I walked into the room where Glenda waited.", "It was a spacious room, and seemed almost like a small civil courthouse, but it gave the appearance of being in a Senate hearing. Red and maroon everywhere, which made the chestnut wood chairs seem right at home. I walked up the aisle, taking it all in, when I saw her.", "\"Hello there Bryan. It's time to find out your name. Have a biscuit.\"", "I took a biscuit, but I couldn't eat. My stomach was kind of uncomfortable. Why? It's not like this'd matter in the long term. Ugh.", "\"I'm not gonna waste too much time, but I always ask, what do you expect your name to be?\"", "\"I have no goddamned clue.\"", "Glenda smirked and looked directly at me.", "\"Normally, Bryan, I explain the person's title after they get it. But this time, I'll tell you first. I know how your high school experience changed you. You didn't feel worth it.\"", "Now I REALLY wanted to throw up.", "\"But you persevered. Through all the crap people gave you. You were a sad soul, hell maybe you still are. But you never gave up on yourself.\"", "What was she talking about? I totally did. I almost committed suicide. They drove me to the brink.", "\"I'll cut to the chase. Your new title, Bryan, is the Survivor of Sadness.\"", "Huh?", "\"Your Honour? Why is that such a big deal? Aren't boys like me MEANT to do that?\"", "A tear found itself at my eye. To this day, I don't know if it was from happiness from being understood, or sadness from not realising that my experiences weren't meant to be normal.", "At least I got a bitchin' title out of it.", "This isn't part of the story, but please support people with depression and help to combat suicide. No one, regardless of gender, should be made to feel like they're not worth it. ", "\"Ah yes, you shall be known as John, Traveler of Forty Shoe Stores.\"", "The line was thinning out now. I peeked ahead to where John was breathing a sigh of relief. 'Shoe stores' was harmless. You could still get a job with that on your resume.", "The next student walked forward, Becky I think. She was wearing a long sleeved sweatshirt and nervously tugging at the sleeves with her hands.", "The village elder Glenda smiled and ushered her forward, putting on the same melodramatic voice that made her words echo through the amphitheater. \"Becky, on your twenty-first birthday, I see your entire life flash before me.\" With a puff of incense the seer closed her eyes, putting one hand on her temple and waving the other around in a way that felt as mystical as a stage magician. \"From this day forward, you shall be known as... Becky, Owner of Seven Cat Habitats!\"", "Becky seemed relieved, if a little embarrassed, and headed down to the audience once again. You'd think people in this town would have better things to do than watch the daily ceremonies at sunset, but it was a pretty packed house today. I looked into the crowd and saw my own parents: Tom, the Destroyer of Alcoholic Beverages, and Mary, the Only Survivor of Math Camp. They were both beaming proudly, and waved at me.", "\"My my, Steven, you shall be known as: The Man with Fifty Fetishes!\" The crowd started to laugh, and Steven turned bright red as he ran out of the stone circle.", "My turn next. Glenda, Devourer of Fifty Three Chicken Nuggets in a Single Sitting, eyed me up and down. \"Amy, my dear, come closer. There's no reason to be frightened.\"", "I don't think I looked particularly frightened, more indifferent, but this was all part of Glenda's show. That being said, if she was going to put a tagline on every novel I ever wrote, it had better be a good one.", "\"Oh, I see great things in your future, but the titles I give are based on the here and now. From this day forward...\"", "Something had just occurred to me. Why was Glenda's title so mundane?", "\"You shall be known as...\"", "Weren't seerers given their powers at birth?", "\"Amy: Disprover of Fraudulent... Potatoes.\"", "Glenda seemed upset, and she ushered me off the stage quickly. The audience didn't know how to react to my new title, and to be honest I was a little confused myself.", "Someone in the crowd spoke up. \"Um, Glenda, did you mean fraudulent politicians?\"", "Glenda paused. \"Yes, yes, of course! What did you think I said? Anyway, that's enough for today, I shall see you all on the morrow!\" Glenda bowed and spun through her fine silk curtains, before high tailing it across the fields at a breakneck pace.", "The day was winding down to an end, as the orange streaks of the setting sun stretched out across a once blue sky. Michael was sat in his room furiously typing away at his keyboard. Papers, notes, and small devices lay across his desk and room floor. Had anyone walked in on him, they would have seen what could only have been described as a dishevelled maniac hacking away at the laptop. However, Michael was far from crazy, he was determined. The naming ceremony was tomorrow, and although he had managed to do countless deeds of worth in his life, tonight\u2019s would be his greatest accomplishment to date.

How can I be of assistance?\u201d it responded.\nMichael was giddy with excitement, spending the next few hours testing E-V on different kinds of commands from opening files to creating complex algorithms for cyber-warfare, all while it maintained a pleasant conversation with Michael. He was pleased to note that it passed in every aspect. His stomach growled loudly, he had not eaten all day and now that he was down, was absolutely famished. \u201cE-V, find a take-out place and order me some food.\u201d He said smugly.\n\u201cE-V, do you have any preference, sir?\u201d it responded.\nMichael felt as if he were floating on cloud nine, \u201cSurprise me.\u201d", "In half an hour of chatting later, the doorbell rang.

Done anything worthwhile.\u201d The delivery man smirked, giving Michael a gentle nudge and a wink.\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll see. No worries.\u201d Michael said as he paid the man, bidding him goodnight.\nHeading into the kitchen, he opened the plastic bag and container that was inside.

In minutes, he had felt as stuffed as a pig and happily made his way to bed.", "The next morning, he awoke to the sound of his sister knocking on his front door. \u201cMichael? Come on, you\u2019re going to be late!\u201d she called from outside.\n\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d Michael said groggily as she stumbled out of bed, struggling to put his clothes on. His stomach produced a sickening gurgle that stopped Michael in his tracks. \u201cOh shit!\u201d he said louder this time with a sense of urgency. He bolted to the bathroom and spent the next ten minutes doing unspeakable things to his toilet, agony rang out in his voice with each passing minute, the smell alone would require a special team to come and quarantine the area. \u201cMichael?\u201d his sister called out once more.\n\u201cComing! Give me a minute!\u201d he yelled desperately. I can\u2019t miss the ceremony! He thought, grabbing the toilet paper. In one swift wiped he checked the toilet paper, completely blank.

In a few minutes he was outside, his sister already waiting in the car. \u201cHurry up!\u201d she yelled.", "When they arrived at the ceremony, everyone was already in line for their new titles.

Since Mother Glenda had fallen on the stairs to the abbey a few summers ago, a complex procession was developed whereby the entire congregation marched down to her villa, complete with chants, candles, incense; once, self-flagellation courtesy of Brother Buick, Spiller of His Own Blood More Than Any Other, in a gross miscalculation on Father Caprice's part.

This journey was brought on by a bout of fasting\u2014traditional in some nearby villages, before a Title is given\u2014which she broke with such vigor that it became her namesake a full week before the ceremony. The visions did not end there, however, nor did her wisdom, and the Title became much less said than 'Mother', for she was the only one we all permitted to give us such a thing as a second name.

Ice didn\u2019t really know. She wasn\u2019t ever really interested in magic. Well, except for elemental magic, for obvious reasons, but as far as she was concerned that was something else entirely. Not just another facet of the unimaginable potential of the arcane arts, but something more rooted in the world. A way of life, that\u2019s what it was.", "With a start Ice realized the line had moved forward again. ", " She stepped forward, hoping her nerves didn\u2019t show to the crowd that had gathered. She shouldn\u2019t be nervous. It\u2019s not like she\u2019ll even be around here much longer. But she hadn\u2019t expecting to take part in this ceremony, and it threw her off guard. She had left the town and joined a mercenary company, Sharp Edge, when she was 16. She wanted to see the world, make a name for herself and, most of all, get out of that tiny corner of the world. She left her mother, her home, and her friends behind.", "By the time she was 19, though, she wanted to move on again. She traveled on her own for a while, and ended up near home. She had been back for about two months, and was planning on setting off again soon. But. She was here for her 21st birthday, and that meant she was taking part in the ceremony.", "Ice looked out at the crowd. Everyone was talking, laughing and joking about what name Glenda would give to the young woman she was quietly speaking with now. A few of them seemed to be eyeing her. Not really surprising. Even if it weren\u2019t for the reputation of a reckless troublemaker she had made while growing up, a fire genasi tends to stand out. Even here in Eberron, genasi are extremely rare.", "They were probably talking about which fire she had started her Epithet would come from. That\u2019s what everyone would expect - something about fire. Not that Ice minded - it\u2019s just that sometimes she got tired of people looking at her and never seeing anything more than just fire. Maybe that was why she kept the name Ice when they had given it to her. Her mother named her Adria when she was born, but following genasi tradition she chose a name after her element when she was 8.

The townsfolk had shortened it to Ice and spent a good week laughing at their joke, but Ice decided to keep it.", "Ice took a deep breath to steady herself. She ran her hand along the sheath of her sword. It was a Flame Tongue, a blade enchanted to be able to burst into flames. It had been a gift from her section when she left Sharp Edge, and it had gotten her out of more than a few tight situations. She thought about pulling it out and running her fingers along the intricate flame patterns embossed into the metal, but thought better of it. That would look pretty strange here in front of everyone. ", "Now. It was time. Glenda beckoned her onto the small podium on the side of the square. The crowd brightened - they had been waiting for this. Ice stepped up and walked over to Glenda. She curtsied and gave the traditional greeting. \u201cPeace favor you, Glenda Sabel, Devourer of 53 Portions of Chicken in One Sitting.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you, Aestus Concalesco, Who is Without Epithet.\u201d Glenda took a moment to look at Ice. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d", "\u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d Ice nodded. Glenda placed her hands on Ice\u2019s temples and closed her eyes. Ice gasped - she saw all of her strongest memories in rapid succession. The time she accidentally burned down the abandoned barn on the edge of town; the time she got into a fight with a much older boy and broke her arm; the time she had borrowed a horse from the inn and charged down the streets, calling herself a knight. Everything she had ever done was replayed right there, in perfect clarity. It seemed to go on forever, but at last it faded.", "Ice shuddered as she came back to the present. She couldn\u2019t have said if it had lasted a moment or an eternity. She felt as though she might fall to her knees, but Glenda\u2019s surprisingly firm grip helped support her.", "Glenda turned to the crowd, which was waiting expectantly, the last laughs from some proposed Epithet dying as everyone held their breath.", "\u201cAestus Concalesco, On the Balance of Life and Death.\u201d", "The square was filled with silence, and everyone felt it. The crowd, suddenly sobered, could only watch Ice and Glenda. No one moved, no one made a sound. Ice turned from Glenda to the townsfolk.

All of the cosmos was fixated on my exact point in space with scorn and mocking shitfaced smirks.
