Chemical signals (either environmental, hormonal, etc.) or perhaps a damaged or mutated meristem induces a change in the orientation of division of single cell (from anti to perclinal, I believe). This signals peripheral cells to also change the orientation of their cellular division. The change in division orientation creates a strict polarity between what becomes the dorsal (lower part of a the lead facing the earth) and the ventral side (upper), which is is regulated by a pathway of microRNAs.
