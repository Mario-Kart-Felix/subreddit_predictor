Stuff like this are needed to make the switch the next wii. YouTube and Netflix are big things needed as well. Without these all these the most I see the switch doing is selling to Nintendo fans. That's great but Nintendo needs to also sell to mainstream gamers as well. They COULD MAYBE survive without triple a games and just first party ips and indie games. However I think Nintendo shouldn't try and play it on hard mode and do it normal or easy mode. I love Nintendo but they can't afford to mess this up. They mess this up witch I don't think they're doing and i can see Nintendo possibly going the way of saga. However is Nintendo does this right and is successful then Microsoft is going to try to make a switch version of their own ( I didn't mention Sony because it's easier to do since the psp can be revamped and made a competitor and if that happens then no doubt Microsoft will do it). I could see this possible hybrid system race lead to a power war like Xbox and Sony are in right now. As for Nintendo they might stay out of the race power wise because they haven't been in the power race lately. Nintendo is once again possibly trend setter in the industry. I hope they don't screw this up as Sony and Microsoft would try to stray away from the the hybrid or mobile systems that I see possibly becoming the industry norm if Nintendo is successful.
