Do HIIT two or three times a week in addition to your program. I prefer simply going to the track (or a huge set of stairs, or a hill, ect) and do a sprint routine. Depending on fitness level (assuming you go to a track) start off with 5 laps. Sprint the straits, walk the sides, and time yourself. That is 10 100 yard sprints. Continue doing the same routine just try to push yourself 'harder' and finish the work 'faster' each time. After a month time yourself. The goal is to be able to do the same amount of work, but faster; this is progress.. From there you can keep it the same and try for better times, or add a lap. The goal is that you are absolutely red lining your body. It's not about how logn you go, its about how hard you can push your body. This is why I really recommend 2 days a week max. Give it 6 weeks and just from this, your cardio will be immensely better. Quick Personal Story: In 2012 I joined the US Navy, prior to that I was 230 lbs, fat, slow, horrible cardio. I did strictly this sprint routine 2 times a week and lifted weights 2x a week. When I got to boot camp I was 185lbs and one of the fastest runners there. Not only fast, but I could run an easy 3 miles even though in my training, nor my life, have I ever ran further than a mile in one single outing. Just remember, HIIT is exaclty what it says HIGH INTENSITY, meaning you can't do it everyday; and if you do, your doing it wrong. Let your body recover before doing the workout. The goal is to progress your work/time ratio, not to constantly beat yourself in the ground. Only if your body has fully recovered, will you be able to beat a previous time.

If so, how do you like it?", "Congrats bro I look like you in the first pictures if not even skinnier (5' 10\" 130 pounds) and I struggle to gain weight and workout everyday. I am 25 now and still trying to gain weight. I find it hard for me to get hungry (breakfast especially) and sometimes I just down massive weight gain shakes to get a shit ton of calories in me.. I box and train almost every day and run a mile but still gain no weight.. gain a little muscle but I am pretty much the same size", "any tips?", "Your traps look huge but you cheated us of seeing those ", "Looks great and natural.", "You look absolutely fantastic, great work! ", "I'm 6'4\" and 195lbs, but still skinny and with random love handles :(", "Plot twist that's a normal sized vest he's really a giant\nPS thanks for your service!!", "Idk what happened, but the first time i clicked your \"after\" link, it took me to an album of godzilla.", "wow. ", "Congrats on all the progress.  But I really wanna know:", "How shitty was buds?  ", "I love reading about the navy seal training programs, just because they clearly require an inhumane level of mental toughness.", "What's it like being Captain America? ", "Omg. U hawt. ", "Hi! I know nothing about fitness but I just want to say: \n\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d \n-All females ever \n:) ", "And those who are looking down on you are probably fucking losers anyways so fuck em.", "So true. Effort in working out is always to be respected.", "God damn son. Congratulations. You look like a fuckin' beast.", "Your story struck a chord with me because I am your old body type and have a very similar story.", "I joined the Army over a decade ago at 130 lbs and 6' with the dream of becoming a Green Beret. I did 2yrs in the infantry including Afghanistan. After the Afgh trip I did PT on my own time to train up for SFAS (SF selection) but my diet was awful. Got up to 150 soaking wet. Got selected, went on to do the Q course and earned my Green Beret, did 10 years in the regiment before dropping my ETS papers. My diet was and still is, awful. Heaviest I ever got was 160 but I looked more skinny-fat (but still strong) than anything else.", "My best lifting numbers were around 2009, these are 5 rep maxes: ", "Bench: 165 ", "Squat: 230 ", "Deadlift: 320 ", "OHP: 105 ", "The insane thing was that my deadlift essentially doubled up from 150 over the course of a year and the entire time my weight stayed around 155. My bench was always fucking awful and I would constantly injure a shoulder trying to push myself until I recently discovered 'retract the motherfuckin' scapula.' Game changer, wow.", "Now, I'm still a skinny bastard but my numbers have dropped way off. I would love to hit 180 lbs and seeing what I might look like is pretty inspiring for this old former Green Beret. I'm 36 now and have accomplished every other life goal I've ever had: the obvious one I've already mentioned, travel the world (the nice places, I mean), write a book, climb my way out of debt, finish my Bachelor's. Force feeding myself every 2 hrs has always been my greatest weakness though. I have no excuses, I've just never stuck to it. And I may never will, but that doesn't mean I'll stop trying. I just fucking hate cooking haha. Seeing your photos is truly inspiring. Oh and this being the internet and all I figured I'd include some ", " with my claims. That's me overseas at 150 lbs carrying my 230 lb teammate while doing some range training.", "Anyways I'm talking about myself way too much so here's one last thing. Don't ever be embarrassed that you tried out for the Navy SEALs and failed. The fact that you attempted it and committed your life to such a worthy cause by enlisting - a huge sacrifice in and of itself - is a greater achievement than many people will ever have.  And not only that, but you went to BUD/S! Getting there is an achievement itself. So many haters only care about whether or not you earned the title but those idiots have ", " how much work you did. But I do. And I've worked with Navy EOD overseas, lots of respect there and you will definitely get your operate on if you want to.", "There are so many men out there who will grow old thinking they should have tried out, but never did, and will regret it. Not everyone gets what they want out of life, but we can get some of those things, and should probably be content with what we have. So again, from one skinny guy to a former one: congratulations on all your work and all you've achieved. I know tons of guys who did steroids just to get there so even more respect that you did it through hard work. What's your next goal?", "God ", ". :wolf whistle:", "What special operations job do they having doing now? And how many bodies do you get to stack?", "When I was in Iraq, I decided to train for Ranger school and RIP. I was at about 180 pounds, pretty lean, but still alot of soft spots. Worked out three times a day, because why the fuck not. Started out with a larger meal in the morning, and gradually worked my way down to a small bowl of cereal every day. I dropped to 165 pounds which is the smallest I have EVER been. Worked my way up to 200 pounds. ", "I was a beast, shirts were too small for me, I went from being able to wear small/medium to medium/large, just because my arms/chest/neck area got so huge. Also had to by specific pants (ACU pants) for my legs because they increased in size. I averaged about 40 miles a week. Every week.", "All in all, I actually ended up fucking myself up on a land nav course and failed RIP because I couldn't compete. It all went downhill from there. This is years ago, so I am a civvie now. And am fat. Also have alot of health related issues, but still maintain a decent metabolism.", "Tl;dr \nAwesome job, brother. Proud of you for not giving up. Be careful with your body, and don't strain too much. Always get medical check ups and stay on it.", "From a Soldier to a (Seamen) Fellow Warrior :)", "looks like military's good for somethin", "Impressive!", "Congratulations, I'm actually almost 16 and 105 pounds.\nI take all these drinks and bars and eat fatty foods and my weight WILL NOT increase. \nI lift m/w/t/f and still nothing. ", "Awesome progress. I'll always envy those who start skinny. ", "Good job packing it on!  You look great!", "Solid progress man. I actually tried to go ND myself but didnt make it out of CEODD. However the re-rate gods had mercy on me and put me in a rate, AWO, that allowed me to get an officer package in. So i'm about to head to USNA. ", "How have you liked being a EOD tech? From the outside it honestly looks like the best job in the world, and after meeting a few dudes, I really want to try and be in that community. Anything you can tell me about it? From work ups, average guy size, cardio expectation in training ( Not CEODD but Dive school, jump, Eglin), and any other personal things you want to say about it?", "Also, how'd you get your run time down so low? I absolutley suck at running. I run my 1.5 mile in 10:14 right now, squat about 265, bench 225, deadlift 340, and I'm 5ft 5 151 lbs.", "Thanks a lot for posting this. I'm also a really skinny guy (5'10, 135 lb., 24) and am just getting more serious about putting on weight. I'm in my second week of 5x5 and have started tracking my calories, supplementing my meals with high-calorie shakes, and making a point to pretty much be snacking all day. Your before pictures look a lot like me now and your progress is mind-blowing. Keep up your hard work and thanks for being an inspiration to those of us just starting the journey.", "You're an inspiration to all of us skinny guys!\nAny words of wisdom? Or general advice?", "I'm a freshman in high school right now. I'm  6'0 125lbs  and am prob at going to be growing more in height I felt like I was \"fat\" throughout middle school and got taller and slimmed out to the point I am now underweight. I've been lifting for about 3 weeks I'm not seeing results but I'm hoping I'm gaining weight haven't weighed myself in a while ", "I'm actually insanely curious about what your rate is.
