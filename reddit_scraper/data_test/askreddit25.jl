The radiation happened between resections 2 and 3. It was hell for him. It didn't help stop the cancer from growing, and my husband had two more resections and an emergency surgery after the radiation was complete. ", "During this time I got pregnant and had a baby boy. Trying for a baby was a contingency plan if the cancer ever came back. We wanted kids but we wanted to wait until we were graduated and settled into our careers, but if my husband needed more surgery we agreed to try for a baby before surgery. We had one month to try and were totally surprised when we conceived. Our son gave my husband the strength to fight this cancer and the motivation to focus on his recovery.

And when you have a second child you worry that you don't have enough room to love the second child as much as the first, but then your heart grows again and you're overflowing with love.

I'm forgiving and that all seemed reasonable, just a girl down on her luck. I knew about where she was and happened to be around that area of town on day so i texted her to see if she was busy. She wasn't doing anything and invited me right over.\nI arrived and went to the door. She came out bare foot and asked if i wanted to walk around the neighborhood. It was winter and we are now walking around an apartment complex with her barefoot. Just across the street was a grocery store and she wanted to run in for jelly beans. i don't ask many questions so in we went, her still not wearing shoes or socks, for the jelly beans. This grocery store has candy you can purchase by the pound. So she goes to the jelly bean dispenser and gets a few handfuls then shoves them in her pocket. I was making enough money at the time to not wind up on a security tape with this girl stealing candy so I insisted she let me buy her some. She said something like \"no I'm going to give you a story to tell your friends later.\" She also had some money on her and wanted a jar of pickles. So after the pickles were purchased we went back to her place. I was out of my comfort zone but still pretty excited. We went around to the back of her apartment which was her room. For the first time im starting to really question things. I don't know where the alarm went off - it could have been the corner by the door with the shotgun uncased and just out. It could have been the blow up chair. It could have been the filthy bong beside her bed that she was comfortable with. It could have been her cursing at her mom when we walked in. It could have been the poor puppy in another corner stuck in a small crate with a blanket over the top taking away most of the rooms view. What i lit up on was the school books and book-bag in the corner. i said \"oh you go to 'local community college' i went there a few years ago\" she said \"no, I go to 'school name'\" \n..... thinking. thinking. connecting some dots....HOLY SHIT! \n\"like 'school name' the high school?!?\" her: \"Yes\" me: \"How old are you??\" her: \"16 - but its legal in this state so whats it matter?\" me: Nope nope nope.

We had an hour wait for a table, but luckily that hour was filled by complete utter silence.  Dinner was awkward.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked her if she still wanted to see the band.  Nope.

It sticks and you have to lift and pull the door in before it'll open.  Her eyes are WIDE OPEN looking at me, as she tries to open the door frantically.  I tell her it sticks, and lean over to open it for her.  She SCREAMS.  I mean, like I'm going to rape her or something.  I get the door open as she counter-rapes my ear with her screams.

I own my home, have a career - but I didn't want to lose all my savings to pay to have it done through a clinic and sperm donation, etc.   It would have been at least $15K per try.

We had two children together, but sex with him was like...dry toast. Having limited sexual experience before him, I just assumed this was normal. Looking back, he mentioned thinking about men while we dated. I brushed it off. Three months after he finally left me and our daughters, I turned on a tablet he used to use and found his Google account still logged in. His Google photos account was photos of him with men in various sex acts.", "I can't ever tell anyone about this. So many people thought we were the perfect couple with a beautiful family.

I'm 31, heathy and in good shape, but I spent almost 10 years being a devoted stay at home mother and wife to a man with many dark secrets and now I have to learn how to do everything all over again. No career experience. Two years of college. Thankfully I have no debt and two beautiful daughters. ", "I just wish that people would stop pressuring me about why my marriage ended. Please.

I moved to California when I was 18 fresh outta HS. I was living with my uncle and I was super bored cause I didn't know anyone besides him and some distant family memebers. I joined datehookup.com just to meet some guys and go out. I met some guy who seemed nice. He was 27, in the army, really cute. So I texted him for a few days and he wanted to hang out. So one day I told my uncle I was going to the park and we met up there. I didn't want my uncle to see him.", "So we meet up in the park and talked for a while.

I told him I'm living with a family memeber and I don't want them to see me with a guy and he said okay so he walked away and after he got into his car I went back home.", "After that day so ghosted him completely. He started messaging me on the dating site. I deleted the profile. A private number called me a week later and it was him. He angrily said that if I didn't send him a picture of my breasts he was gonna come to my house and beat me. I called his bluff then he said \"you know I saw you walking into your apartment complex right? NOW the area I lived in had a lot of apartment complexes but I was too afraid to take a chance. I begged him to stop and asked him why he was doing this to me", "He said because he caught feelings and I led him on. He was emotionally unstable seriously. He made it seem like we were dating for years. Sigh. I asked him to just leave me alone and he said that he won't until I send the picture. He said \"make sure your face is showing so I know you're not lying to me. Sooo red puffy eyes and all I snapped a pic and sent it to him. He told me to send him a full nude body pic next or he was gonna post the photo of me on the internet. I was truly mortified. I was gonna send the photo but I said fuck toy and do whatever you need, you come here and I will call the police and have you arrested for harassment and possessing child pornography cause I was really 16 (I was really 18 I just wanted to scare him) ", "After I said that he hung up on me. I lived in fear for a week. But then things got a little better and I wasn't as paranoid that a nude photo of me was somewhere on the net. Two weeks pass and I haven't heard from the guy. I'm laying down and it's 12am. This guy texts me and says \"how's the movie you black slut?\" My heart dropped cause I just cut the DVD on. I was really scared and creeped out and seriously considered calling the cops. But I didn't. So a week later I told my mom and dad Cali wasn't working out and asked them if they could send me a ticket to come back home.

He harassed me and I moved back home to NY because of it.", "When I was 23  I finally found out why we would always leave the family parties if a certain great uncle showed up. Turns out he had molested his own children for years. Then he adopted younger children every few years and did it more. He eventually went to jail in the 80s and 90s and people would still take his kids to visit him in jail. They hated it. Anyways, I find out later that we would always leave fast because he molested my mother when she was a child. Around 4 or 5 years old. My family is close and that made me rage. And then I find out that he had recently been in trouble again got similar things. Found him on the sex offenders list. Went to his house at night. Knocked in his door and asked if I looked familiar. I beat the shit out of him and took money and some values. Threatened him. Left. No one knows to this day. He made up a story on what happened to him. Apparently he still goes to family events.

In my mind, I feel justified and have tenuous plans to make it right one day when I can.  However, if it was found out my wife would probably kill me and I'd never be able to face my in-laws again.", "The basic story is that my father-in-law had made our life and his family's life a living hell for many years.  He was an alcoholic who would get drunk every day, verbally harass his family, and occasionally beat his wife.  My wife lived with him while we were dating and I was glad to have removed her from that situation once we got married and moved into our own place.", "However, I soon learned that this would not let us be rid of him.  Though we moved to a new house, we were still in the same city as my in-laws.  One night we were surprised by a knock at the door at 1 am to find my father-in-law, stinking drunk, wanting to come in.  He had been kicked out of his own house and my wife let him in, out of sympathy, and we had to endure his drunk ramblings for the next few hours until he finally fell asleep.", "These late night visits would become a regular occurrence for the next four years.  Even after my wife and I had a baby, he would come over late at night and insist on receiving food and an audience for his drunk ramblings, leading to many sleepless nights.  Occasionally, I'd refuse him entry, only to face threats from him and consternation from my wife for being so unsympathetic.  After all, in her mind, he was suffering from a disease and I should regard him as a victim of illness.", "The only respite we would have is when he would go to jail.  Sometimes for domestic abuse and sometimes for other charges related to his drinking.  ", "I remember being generally pissed off at the time.  Much of it aimed at my in-laws, who just decided to lock him out every night, knowing he would eventually wander to my house and become our problem.  I also remember being resentful of my mother-in-law for not calling the police on him more often.  The only time police were called were when circumstances were extreme and one of the kids would call.  However, I was most pissed at the judicial system, who continually let this obvious menace out of jail to repeat what he had been doing for years. ", "This is where the money comes in.  My in-laws don't own cars and don't drive.  So, being the good son-in-law, but mostly caving under pressure from my wife, I would always be the one who'd have to take him to court dates, to lawyers' offices, post bond, get him from jail, etc.  Some times I'd have to take off entire days from work to take care of his legal problems.", "Well, one day we learned that he had beaten another drunk almost to death and was charged with attempted murder.  Bond was $10,000.  The family spent several weeks getting the funds together from their money, but also from extended family.  They were so used to posting bond and losing it that it'd become routine.", "Long story short, my father-in-law was convicted and sentenced to several decades given his long criminal history.  I remember breathing a sigh of relief that we wouldn't have to deal with him for the foreseeable future.  However, due to some court technicality the bond was returned.  Since I posted the bond, the check was in my name for $10,000 and interest.  The in-laws, who were used to losing their bond payments and quite legally/financially illiterate, would have no idea.", "So, I decided to pay myself.  I know it was their money, but I felt justified given the time I had to give and emotional hardship I had to go through when they refused to clean their hands of this matter.", "Again, I don't feel right about it, and if I can get that much money at one time again, I want to make it right.  However, that day is not today.", "I've been in a strictly sexual relationship with a first cousin for the last five years.

What started as us meeting up one in awhile has become a regular thing in the last few months.  It's escalated to the point where we're now sexting each other.I'm scared to death of what might happen if anyone in our family finds out but I don't want to stop what's happening either.", "Here's the story:\nIt all started out very slow before it escalated into full on sex. I was informed by another cousin of ours and asked to help her move since I was free at the time. We started hanging out throughout that summer and then one afternoon we had brunch and then went back to chill at her apartment. It was a super hot day so we thought let's just go indoors and relax and watch some TV or a movie. I can't remember what we were watching but we were chatting the whole time too, just talking about our relatives and what we were looking to do with our lives and careers. After awhile she kind of just leaned on me and got comfortable and I threw my arm around her (almost instinctively) and were just hanging out like that for a bit. Eventually she gave me a lingering look that was kind of asking \"what's happening here?\" and we both went in for a kiss. We were both shocked that it happened but we got over it fast and started making out and running our hands all over each other until my hand was up her skirt touching her thru her panties and then I realized what we were doing and stopped it from going any further. We both came to our senses and stopped before anything went any further. We decided to forget it happened and move past it but every time we met up after that we'd make out and push our boundaries until we eventually ended up having sex. Afterwards, we were meeting up regularly until we both got really busy with work and only met up on occasion. We completely stopped when each of us had a significant other but would start hooking up again every so often when we are single. As mentioned before, now it's become a regular occurrence where we hook up multiple times a week and we've been sexting with each other now.", "Edited out \"One thing led to another\" since a good number of people were irked with that and elaborated on how it happened.", "Edit #2 - This really blew up. I've spoken to her since this was posted and to address some of the comments, we are 100% taking every precaution to make sure that she does not get pregnant. She is on the pill and we use condoms. If for some reason she does get pregnant, we are both on the same page about an abortion and don't intend to have an incest baby. What we're doing is purely physical and neither of us have any intention of pursing anything beyond what is currently happening.", "Also, yes, I'm aware we can stop this whole thing and put an end to it but that's easier said than done. At this point in our lives we're both physically comfortable with each other and know what the other likes so it's made it a bit difficult to just end it, especially since outside of us meeting up we're both very busy with our lives and careers so it's just convenient. We're both currently single and as I mentioned before, if either one of us starts to date someone we don't hook up. We both enjoy what we're doing but the only issue we have is just the anxiety of being found out. We did agree to keep this a secret from friends and family because we're afraid that they wouldn't understand and we don't want to deal with that potential shit storm. She admits that she may have gotten a little too comfortable since this is the longest interval with us hooking up since this started happening and is going to dial it back to make sure we don't accidentally out ourselves.", "I get paid a six figure salary for a standard 40 hour a week corporate job for a massive well known company.

I did not make many friends and so when I met my then best friend it was so great. I was probably 11 I guess when it happened and really sheltered. We did everything together and he was a really good friend but he started changing. He started acting more effeminate and looking back he was learning/growing into his sexuality. We were best friends and there was a trust between the two of us. He started wanting to run around naked and look at me naked and I was a late bloomer so I had no idea that this was sexually based, thought it was just guy stuff. He never did anything to me other than grab my penis and try to jerk me off while I was flaccid, I was 11 and not gay so I didn't know what was going on. He then started getting really mean and made fun of the size of my penis all the time and became really toxic to be around. I just wanted my friend back. I quit hanging out with him and made other friends and blocked out what happened to me but every now and then I remember and I almost feel like I was raped. I think it did a number to my confidence growing up. The only person I have slept with is my wife because I was always so worried about the size of my dick. I realize now that it was stupid to be so worried about it because if the person you are with is so concerned about something like that then they just aren't meant for you and it is time to move on.  I just wish it never happened to me, I know other stories here are way worse but this is mine and it was traumatic to young me.

I told it to my boyfriend and my best friend last year, but they don't know the men personnaly, and I asked them to not say anything. But I can't tell my parents, or anybody of my family because they have their own problems and it would ruin these friendships and their friends. The greatest irony in all that is that I suffered from a great depression during two years that almost destroyed my bonds with my parents, and I was unable to express them why I felt that way. Two months ago, I was with my parents on a great reconciliation week-end and on the road to get back home, my father spontaneously decided he wanted to stop by his best friend to give him something. HE was there, and this was the first time I saw him since the rape. My mum saw how bad I felt, and I couldn't tell her neither., and she thought I was rude and we fought again.
