They don't want to give her more damage, and I doubt they will, hack damage amp included.", "The real problem here is that she shouldn't be in the DPS category.

Hero Roles indicate the latter, but in practice the game always devolves down to get a kill/pick and push against a handicapped team. This is why Roadhog, Soldier, and Anna are overpowered. Roadhog can immediately eliminate any hero, having no real counter, and Soldiers insane reliable DPS means he can melt just about anyone (sprinting away if under fire). Negligeable Damage drop off too. Anna's ridiculous heal rate keeps teams alive from damage over time from heroes like Tracer, Sombra, Genji and Winston making anyone who can't get a kill in under 1.5 seconds  consistently useless.", "Blizzard needs to decide if it wants all the heroes to be equally viable for damage and survivability, or equally overpowered for what they uniquely do.

It's kind of like a mini Tactical Visor that can be used every 12 but only on one target at a time.
