If they pull back, remove your hand, or react negatively in any fashion that's a clear signal. Anything else, indifferent or positive, is a sign of comfort, and ultimately a good thing.

They're not put off by you touching them? Good. Etc. ", "And finally.... if you're having good conversation and have broken the touch barrier, the last step is the hardest and simplest. Fucking do it. Move close, make eye contact, whatever seems natural and appropriate. Again... Express your intentions with body language and judge the reaction. If you're holding eye contact and relatively close, look at their lips. In fact... Look at their lips. Once you've sensed there is mutual desire, close the gap and alternate between eye contact and looking at their lips. This lets them know what you're thinking. ", "And then.... The hard part.... Just fucking do it. If you've made it this far and they have shown the signs and hesitate when you try... At that point... It's not even your fault. But if you've made it this far and they're still showing interest, based on my experience, they won't hesitate. They're waiting for you to step up and go. So fucking step up and go already.

For example, what do they call ice cream in North Korea?\u2014\"Eoleumbosungi\" (it sounds cute to me). (3) Economic issues. I think South Korea is way more developed and sensitive to new trends compared to North Korea. So, if there is a reunification of the North and the South, it might be hard to balance the both.

NASA had asked for and received clearance to launch below the minimum recommended temperature several times.

I don't mean to malign this district because education standards have plummeted around the country so its not like the district is unique in that regard, and also many of the students came from very challenging backgrounds that affected their education, ability to learn, and so on.

The majority of the class could not name other planets besides earth and mars, and the majority of the class did not know how seasons work, why a year is the term it is, or why we have leap years, time zones, etc. It was a very fulfilling afternoon for me and them as each question prompted another question and each answer made them light up. The classroom had a smart board so we could pull up and read information together as each question was asked and answered, which they really enjoyed. ", "Again not to malign this district, but a big reason the kids were so ignorant was because at this school they simply had not had basic solar system lessons yet...in my day as a child these sort of things were learned in 3rd grade. As a side note, in this district they also do not teach multiplication facts in the 3rd grade; the kids are not required to memorize the times tables at all nor are really taught how to do long division by hand nor are given nearly enough time to learn and understand fractions. This results in all sorts of nonsense when they get to higher math (for example, most of the middle-schoolers and high schoolers could not do math problems at the board because they got stumped when it broke down to multiplying, dividing, anything at all to do with fractions. If they did not have a calculator they could not do it)", "Someone asked how the girl is doing now, I'm sorry to say I have no idea. Like quite a few of the students in this district she moved fairly often so I saw her at other schools from time to time for a few years and then stopped seeing her, so either she moved to a neighborhood in a school I refused to go to anymore or she left the district. She'd be about 10th grade now so I hope she is doing well.", "Thanks for the comments saying I'm a good teacher, and thanks for the ones saying/implying I wasn't also. I really was not, I didn't have much patience or compassion nor the nerves to deal with many of the changes that happened with education in general in my state nor changes within this district in particular. I subbed for 5 years, and by the end of it my nerves were shot and my mouth had no chill. I intended to become a real teacher; I was in a Masters+ certification program but had a come-to-jesus moment when I realized I simply am not capable of being the effective and caring teacher students deserve.

My friends kiddingly refer to me as \"Menno-not\". Used to be Mennonite... now... not so much. The Amish movement is actually an off-shoot of Mennonites (who are themselves an off-shoot of the Methodists Anabaptists) and was founded by Jacob Amman. Mr. Amman and his followers felt the Mennonites were getting too progressive... thus becoming less God-centric. So they dug in their heels and chose to remain less \"worldly\". To this day the Amish live a idyllically plain life. However, to remain competitive the Amish find interesting ways to stay modern. Example... many Amish business people use technology (cell phones, computers, vehicles, etc.) in their businesses. They can do this because they don't actually \"own\" the technology... they lease it.

My grandfather was on a mission outside the camp. When the SS asked for him the Major said he was in medical care and would probably die. When he returned from his mission the Major told him what happened and asked if this was in his interest, and he just replied \"Jawoll, Herr Major\". When he died we found some old letters in his belonging. His brother (who was older and who died in a foxhole in Poland by a granate later) wrote some letters with my grandfathers Hitleryouth officer in which this guy told him that my grandfather was known to be a grumbler in their camp. I still have that letter. My grandfather told me how to survive a war. He said, its pure luck, nothing else. You can avoid certain risks but in the end its luck. About ten years ago i had a chance to meet some other veterans of ww2, germans and some soldiers of the e-company, from the 506th of the 101st Airborne in Bastogne. The german guys had similar stories.

In 1940 his father was injured and sent home for good. Once they were assigned some forced laborers, he decided to join the army or so he said. Because this is were things get fishy. My grandfather always talked about his time at the Wehrmacht and where they trained and what he did for fun with his friends there. There were so many times he would tell me bedtime stories about his time in the war and my dad used to listen to the same stories ('Oh, did he tell that story again?') But it was always him being part of the regular army. Just a simple soldier doing his duty fighting. Nothing about being a Nazi. However, his potraits in uniform that we found after his death showed him in clear SS-uniform and when we looked into the places he went for training, all those places turned out to have been mainly SS-training sites. He must have been an SS-member.", "But it goes to show that, in retrospect, my grandpa was definitely not very proud of his time there. I still remember him telling me not to join the army when it was my turn to get drafted for military service as \"nothing good has ever come from war and destruction.\" We never really thought about him possibly being in the SS since he nevery really exhibited any ideological thinking.

If you're looking at instruments at a pawn shop, check the return policy. I have purchased pawn shop instruments and then taken them to my repair guy to check value vs. repair costs, and returned a few. Occasionally the pawn shops will have a good one. Finally, if cost is a concern (as it is for most people), talk to your teacher about options. Many music stores offer rent to own programs.

Many of the best chefs in the world use the microwave intelligently. Freeze sauces and put them in freezer bags stacked in the freezer.  Don't be pretentious about using a microwave but also learn it's strengths and weaknesses. ", "Knives: Learn how to cut properly. Search for some videos, I believe Gordon Ramsey has a good one. Use your knuckles to guide the blade,  keep your thumb back and your fingers tucked. It will feel awkward at first,  just practice and never let yourself do it the wrong way.

Always have a garbage can nearby or use a dirty pan/bucket or bus tub for garbage. Empty it regularly. One of my biggest pet peeves is people who just scrape food particles onto the floor. ", "Pacing and timing: Often as a cook you will get swamped with orders and you can become very overwhelmed knowing your servers and customers are waiting often impatiently. Learn exactly how many items you can cook simultaneously. If your station is at maximum capacity don't let yourself get stressed out because of the pressure - if your station is full there's often nothing more you can do to speed up the process. The food has to cook. If you get stressed you may drop something, mess up an order, or serve something undercooked. This will NOT make anything better. Again, take the extra fee seconds and do it right. Let the server know if you're at capacity and don't let them stress you out,  they're typically only worried about their tip and have little to no understanding of your situation. Experienced servers will know this and they are very valuable, appreciate them. ", "Kitchen culture: Often in kitchens there is a culture of extreme urgency. This often lends the whole team to be more stressed than necessary. Of course you want to be fast but the best way to consistently put out quality food at a fast rate is to be calm and efficient. Often times having this kind of attitude can cause conflict as cooks and other service workers are almost gluttons for stress,  and if they see you calm they will try to get aggressive.

The kids were expected to come in and help cook in the kitchen. A few hours before lunch, when people were hungry, kids would need to come help make meals or meals wouldn't happen. So kids figured out norms of self-governance to ensure that people would go help in the kitchens. Sometimes it was people who wanted to cook doing it all the time. Sometimes there was a schedule so everybody cooked. We didn't care, but it had to happen.

I think the real problem is the kids get to college, and people expect them to act like kids, build structures and rules around them as though they were, and the kids follow suit. If I've learned one thing in this work, it's that your expectation for what the capabilities of young people are almost universally puts the defining limit on what their capabilities actually are. People generally don't rise to the occassion. They generally fall to the level of their training. So if you build a system where young people see a lot of structure, rules, and guidelines that match their historic expectations (i.e. a college system that largely governs them as though they were still minors), you should expect them to continue along that historic trend. If high schools have as much structure as middle schools, and colleges as much structure as high school, and entry level jobs have as much structure as colleges, you won't see a change.

If anything, I can offer at least one, hopefully insightful perspective.", "The main comparisons for my experiences come from those of my father. He would have been the super-nerd of his time. He never missed a day of school, even if he was sick, he was offered a full ride to the university he attended after applying to the most difficult college they had (simply because he wanted to), he pursued numerous undergraduate research opportunities, and years later he received his doctorate in nuclear physics. This man has been a driving force in my life, and he's pushed me to do better than even he could. Nowadays, he jokes about how I'm even nerdier than he is, and we continuously have discussions about the differences between generations.\nOne of the things we have noticed is that for current students, everything is extremely competitive. Far more competitive than anything he saw during his education. According to my father, I am doing better than he was at my age. My grades in high school were better, I had far more extracurriculars, I was far more involved with school programs, and I learned much more about STEM than he had at my age by the time I graduated. Even with all of that, I was rejected from most of the universities I applied to. If I was lucky, I was deferred or wait-listed, but ultimately my choice came down to two schools. In the end, I chose the same school my father attended, but I received a much smaller scholarship and currently face higher tuitions. I, like a lot of students I know, had to make up the difference with money from our own savings accounts, even after taking out loans. Naturally, I may have received fewer opportunities simply because I was less deserving or not qualified. Maybe I felt too entitled and came off too cocky. I would say this is the case, except every friend I had who was equally capable if not more so ended up in the same circumstances as myself. Despite being one of the most academically successful classes in my high school's history, my class got into fewer schools and received smaller scholarships than past years. We were basically destroyed by the college application process, and the only consolation we had was that it happened to everyone.", "Even in high school there was this prevailing sense of competition. There was a clear division between the \"AP students\" and the rest of the school, and that division only seemed to grow during my four years in high school. Within the AP circle, we were constantly being told to pursue STEM careers, to constantly prepare for standardized tests, to do every extracurricular possible, and to accept nothing less than a 4.0 GPA. Almost every AP student I knew suffered from depression or anxiety of one sort or another, and we each had this deafening fear of failure that even now follows us into college. I went to a high school that still used class ranks, and people would often make fun of me for not getting into good schools, despite being valedictorian. This would have absolutely destroyed me if not for the fact that nobody really did. I realize this paragraph does not have much structure to it, but High School was just a horrible experience looking back. There was so much stress, anxiety, and fear for the future. People often cried over 95% test scores and would beat themselves up about it to frightening extents. I have had to talk numerous friends out of suicide, and I'm sad to say that they have had to do the same for me.\nLuckily, we are all finding college to be better experiences. While the classes are harder and we seriously need to start focusing on careers, things seem more optimistic for once in our lives. Some tough grades at the beginning of the year helped to reduce our fear of failure; however, there is still definitely a prevailing sense of competition. I personally am pursuing degrees in both mechanical engineering and government and politics because I hope that I might gain an edge during the career search, especially when it comes to management positions. I have many friends who are doing the same. We are all happy to be done with high school.", "So in my experience, 2017 kids face far more competition and fewer opportunities than 1997 or even 2007 kids. I have read a lot that teachers do not think that students care as much anymore, but I would assert from my experience that we're taught to care too much and end up getting burnt out.

She then wrote me a bad check and tried to accuse me of trying to \"cash it twice\" and kept threatening to sue me. So, being stereotypically Jewish, I got one of my parents' many lawyer friends to help draft a letter and said I'd be fine to go to a small claims court. At this point it was less about the money and more about hating this fucking bitch.", "About two months later she gave me $500 in cash and I decided to let it go. Some things I've learned since: 1) every person she ever said \"betrayed her\" lent her money only to have her go scorched earth on them 2) She made several thousand dollars on that play and didn't pay back any of the other people she owed (most of whom were just $20-30) and 3) unsurprisingly, she'd been badmouthing me to everyone even before this happened setting me up as the kind of guy that would pull something like this. ", "I've never gotten that close to someone again. She was the closest friend I've ever had and in some ways I still miss that intimacy. I'm eternally grateful our relationship was purely platonic as it could have been so, so much worse otherwise. For the record, her play was a steaming pile of shit and was reviewed by several small time blogs as \"basically the worst thing ever\". She's the only person I've met that I think I would truly not care if I heard she was dying slowly of cancer, but I genuinely want her life to be devoid of any real suffering so the universe won't give her any justification for being such a massive cunt.", "TLDR: Bitch took my money.

She had Hep C and her liver that had been transplanted a couple years prior was failing.  I had been driven up to the hospital 4 hours away after being taken out of school for the day.  It was the phone call we had all prepared for: \"your mother has taken a turn and we want you up here.\"", "My best friend at the time, a flamboyant gay boy (who we shall call Brian), drove my car up to the hospital per my father's and my request.  This boy was very loved by my family.  My mother wanted to throw him a birthday party after he said he'd never had one before.  She bought him birthday cake, expensive cologne from her trip to Las Vegas, you name it.  She treated him like a son, but only because I called him \"friend.\"  He cooked dinner for us sometimes, and my mother trusted him enough to employ her at her bridal shop that she owned.  So, he worked there as a cashier and general back room guy, just like my dad.", "Well, my mother passed on about a week after I got up to see her.  She could no longer speak, she was in a drug-induced coma, and I still have some minor triggers about the experience.  The day she died, they were taking her off oxygen, and they asked each of us if we wanted to be with her.  My father said yes and held her in his arms as she passed, I said no and waited in the next room, Brian said yes and watched my mother die.", "A month passed, and it was summer.  I was at the bridal shop a lot because my dad couldn't quite handle it alone.  Looking back, neither of us could handle it at all.  And Brian knew that...  We found out, thanks to a returning customer and a receipt they brought back, he had stolen upwards of $10,000 from my mother's business by using her screen name and password in our computer system.  We brought the police in and everything, but the police said they couldn't prove it \"beyond reasonable doubt,\" so they had to drop the case cold.  Everyone else knew he did it, and I did too, because that's when the razor blades and \"laundry detergent\" (cocaine) on his window sill finally made sense.", "Brian stole tens of thousands of dollars from my mother after watching her die.  ", "Edit: Y'aaaaaaall, the support is amazing.  You guys are amazing.  I think all I ever wanted was for a bunch of people to hear this story and say, \"Yeah, fuck that dude!\"  I've held onto this story for almost 9 years now, and it's eaten me up.

I then met Liz and really liked Liz.", "Karl then tried to set me up with his friend Amy. Amy and I got along okay, went on a couple dates before I found out she was dating another guy on the side. Was no skin off my back, since it was a casual set up in the first place. And that gave me an opening to start seeing more of Liz.", "I started dating Liz and Karl got grouchy with me, telling me I wasn't good enough for her, and all sorts of overprotective macho nonsense, but we mostly just moved on until I moved out and went to school in another city.", "Liz visited me a couple times, and eventually Karl and Liz went to visit a friend of ours who lives nearish me. I was like \"oh sweet, I'll come too and It'll be a big ol' friends reunion!\" And Karl tells me that's a no go because a guy who lives with them hated me for no reason that was ever given, and apparently none of my other buddies would stand up for me. That hurt, but Liz said she would visit me after. ", "So fine, that happens. Liz comes to visit. And she has a tale to tell. Turns out, Karl and his girlfriend had been having relationship issues, and I had been invited to live with them as a buffer. I moved out and things got worse, they were now on a \"Break\". The reason Karl forbade me from dating Liz? Liz was his back up girl and I was cock-blocking his prospective target. The reason my buddies didn't have my back? Karl told everyone I cheated on Amy, and Karl was using that trip to try and get in Liz's pants despite her and I dating.", "Sooo...TL;DR: Supposed best friend saves me from a jam, not as a friend, but to use me as a pawn in a weird manipulation attempt that didn't work out in his favour but cost me a whole friendgroup.

Just walks her happy ass inside and sits on the couch. So then when I come down the hallway into the living room, the bitch had this super vapid smile on her face. I just had this weird gut instinct that she was hiding something from everyone and was going to fight to the death to keep it hidden.

Joe was the most shitfaced and was on cloud nine after a great gig and some album sales. Suddenly, Joe realised he forgot his keys or something so he announced that he was heading back to the gig venue. Marnie FLIPPED HER SHIT screaming about Joe being too drunk and irresponsible and then started  detailing his rather personal mental health issues from high school. Like, shrieking about self-harm in the middle of this little cocktail bar playing soft jazz on a Saturday night with people nibbling on soft cheeses. Joe wisely decided to just leave. Marnie stomped after him, slamming the bar door. My friends and I, worried that Marnie might actually murder Joe, chased after her down the main street of our town.

Says he is strange and \"not right\". She put it off as ex is jealous, decides to not pay any mind to what he has to say. One summer day we decide to go to a baseball game. All of us (my boyfriend and I included) got a hotel room. Go to the game, tailgate, have fun with a huge group of people but I notice he's not very social with anyone more so just watching her. We are in his truck right before the game and he starts to say weird shit that is just very protective (they've been \"dating\" about 2 weeks) and making me feel uncomfortable \"If that guy tries to hit on you let me know I'll break his arms\". Everyone proceeds to get drunk, we go into the game. They just disappear from this group of 15 people without saying a word. Later that night my boyfriend and I go back to the hotel it's deadbolted, we knock... he answers completely naked. We're confused. Boyfriend tells me grab my things and we're going home. Crazy proceeds to jump back on her to have sex and she was giggling/laughing I assume not noticing us in the dark room??? I really don't have an explanation.

She doesn't respond because she thinks it's childish so he turns around and starts to say how she is a slut, whore, should kill herself... yeah I told her to run as fast as she could. \nHe continued to contact her for about 2 months until she blocked him on everything.
