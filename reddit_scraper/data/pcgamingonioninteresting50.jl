Chemical signals (either environmental, hormonal, etc.) or perhaps a damaged or mutated meristem induces a change in the orientation of division of single cell (from anti to perclinal, I believe). This signals peripheral cells to also change the orientation of their cellular division. The change in division orientation creates a strict polarity between what becomes the dorsal (lower part of a the lead facing the earth) and the ventral side (upper), which is is regulated by a pathway of microRNAs.

I played Eve online for years and I will encourage people to play this game, if they have the time for it.  It is fun and honestly abit scifi space Dystopian.

This game requires other people really to get alot of enjoyment out of.  It is a video game Bar and is very social.  Whether you are a pirate, a miner, an industrial guru, or a fleet leader you need to find some people to hang around with or you might as well go play some single player games.  I personally always enjoyed reading on the politics of nullsec.  With this being said, my love for this game is unrequited.  I am horrible with people, communities and me dont mix and I very often found myself leaving groups in eve because I felt like I didnt fit in or was getting stressed over people being jerks.  I've been alot of things in eve, from a miner and high sec rater to a war deccer and a pirate.  I was even in Test Alliance for a while.  The funnest times I had in that game I have to say was hanging out with my college friends who all eventually left OR hanging out with both bomber's bar and my high sec war dec group ( until we had a falling out because the head guy decided to be a jackass to me).  I wish I could play this game again, I really do, but I can't deal with the rejection of the people in it, it gives me wayyy too much stress.

He had looked into the order error and found that the screen advertised was wrong, and that only the 120Hz TN was available. He offered to cancel my order, I said no, so I'm still waiting for my order now.

In the text chat tell them to contact you back via email as you prefer email, because if you talk to them over the phone you have no proof of what was promised to you unless you recorded the call. Plus, it doesn't look very good on whichever employee you're communicating with if they have like a 30 reply email thread dating back 3 months.
