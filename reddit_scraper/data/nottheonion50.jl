If steam would remove it, that wouldn't force companies to finish their games faster or anything, it would just make it harder for buyers to spot unfinished games. Having the sign is a sort of consumer protection imo.", "One thing I'd like though is to change the label. Early Access sounds like some exclusive deal that you can be glad to have.

But rather people who bought early access when it was just released, thinking they'd probably get a finished game in at most a year. And then 3 years later it's still in early access with major flaws.

Games can take many years to make so why shouldn't the devs get to keep working on it until it is done?", "The way I see it, a hard limit would only decrease the quality of games that are released this way. If people don't want to wait for it to finish being made they can play it in development (for as long as that takes), and if you only want to play finished games then just keep avoiding early access like you have been.", "This seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist to me.

Selling a playable but early version of the game helps them fund them working on it while still trying to complete it. ", "While I do agree that 3-4 years is way too long.

The number of getter something decent is incredibly low and is why Valve do not want to divulge such information. Not only that but the visuals, I. E. the slot-like system where the guns you unlock scrolls past, gives a lot of people the sense of almost winning. I say almost, but we all know that's not true. The % of a high end skin at high quality is low enough, with Stat-Trak, it's even lower. ", "Let us not forget that Valve then sell the crates, the keys, the game itself, as well as cards and skin sales.  At every point, money is made. So much so that each item unlocked, whether good or bad, can be sold again through the marketplace for a second or third cut to Valve. These items could range anywhere from hundreds of dollars to a few cents (I'm British, but just using dollars as the example). Regardless, they get a slice of the same pie, multiple times. This is business, but the morals of such things are nonexistent. First exploit people and then take money from multiple people potentially an unlimited amount of times. Of course in reality this doesn't happen, but given the sheer number of CSGO players,   it all adds up to a tasty sum. Oh and let's not forget, Valve traded easy money making and exploitation in place of actually making new games. ", "That is one company. One of the worst for it, but ultimately will have the support of the people because they provide the platform they use most and/or they run the game (that they didn't even make) that so many play? Does it make the ridiculously low rate of winning something good acceptable? Nope. ", "I suppose one could say, that what looks good is subjective... And sure, it is. Except for the fact that it's visually obvious what looks good and what sucks but is aided further by the colour system that indicates good and shitty weapons. So no, not everyone is a winner... And for the ludicrous price of keys and crates (yes some can drop), given the variables and the extremely low chance of something that is actually categorised as good and looks genuinely nice, those who sink money into that system will often feel disappointed and ultimately try again with future key purchases. ", "I don't know the math behind it, because the crates change and I've not played CSGO for a while but I wouldn't be surprised if the percentage of the top tier stuff is stupidly low.
