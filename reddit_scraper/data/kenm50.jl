Online, the 35-year-old comedian, until recently known only by the moniker \u201cKen M,\u201d plays a good-natured dolt, posting hilariously inept remarks to outrage people who don\u2019t realize the joke is on them. (Underneath an article on the perils of climate change, for example, Ken M demanded that someone \u201ctell obama to plant more tree seeds cause trees convert sunlight into cool air.\u201d) Now he\u2019s something of a folk hero, touting thousands of followers on Facebook and Twitter and his own subreddit. His aim, he has said, is to turn \u201ctoxic\u201d spaces\u2014as so many comments sections tend to be\u2014into \u201ca source of belly laughter, so it\u2019s not gross anymore.\u201d\u2014Samantha Grossman", "We are ALL the most influential people on this blessed day.", "Who the fuck are half these people ", "His aim, he has said, is to turn \u201ctoxic\u201d spaces\u2014as so many comments sections tend to be\u2014into \u201ca source of belly laughter, so it\u2019s not ", " anymore.\u201d\u2014Samantha ", "man", "lol", "My son is in the top 6k figures of influential people on the Internet.", "Good going, Ken!", "Please use this power for evil.", "Seems these days people are more influenced by the things that influence them than the things that don't.", "All I wanted was for there to be ", " in the entry for him.", "Kind of ruins the joke if everyone is in on it, doesn't it?", "What about our friend, the Kanye West?", "I'm glad Ken made the list, but to me this list seemed like utter shit.
