Your muscles will be very tight, and though it never stops, if you don't take the time to stretch them out after each session it will get much worse.

There's not much to say here, I think it's a small factor, but it's still something everyone should do.

You'll see the pay off in the end.", "4) ", " - This was really the biggest lesson of them all. The Squats, Benches, Deadlifts, you name it. These are what make your workouts.

Do all those bicep curls all you wants, but until you deadlift some heavy ass weight off the ground, you body wont change in a big way.", "5) You get a lot of core exercise by doing compound lifts. Is your core weak? Then your compound lifts are being neglected. Ab exercises should not be a major focus of your routine. Ever.", "6) Kettlebells are very awesome. You can do a lot of combination lifts with them, especially if you want to combine aerobic and anaerobic exercise in one fell swoop.

Scientifically our understanding of nutrition in general is pretty terrible, but my understanding is that the all major benefits of a ketogenic diet (outlined nicely by Antranik) occur primarily if you are actually in ketosis.  This is definitely the case for the anti-epileptic and fat-burning benefit and I assume the metabolic benefit correlates with the degree of ketosis as well.  ", "Evolutionarily, the body is actually optimized to run on glucose or simple sugar, and every system in your body runs at or near optimal efficiency on glucose.  It has been proven that you can operate safely on ketones for an indefinite period of time, but the point is that your body doesn't want to -- it wants to run on sugar.  So when you are restricting carbs, your body will always prioritize the metabolism of sugar as an energy source.  So if you eat even slightly above your modest carb threshold, your body is going to use that to fuel/store instead of breaking down fat, and you won't be in ketosis.  Additionally, if you do not replace the carbs with fat (i.e. you eat more protein instead) your body will convert the excess protein into carbs and you won't be in ketosis.  Oh, and every carb re-feed/cheat day?  Your body will store those carbs like its life depends on it and burn them later, making it that much harder/take that much longer to get back into ketosis when you go back on your diet.  ", "My own experience backed up by some of my friends is that you need to restrict carbs to a kind of annoying level to actually reach ketosis -- somewhere around 15-30 g/day.  You might be able to get away with a slightly higher level if you are physically active, but I doubt most people reach ketosis on 40g/day.  How do you know?  Buy a $5 pack of urine dipsticks from the drugstore and test your urine to see if you are excreting ketones.  If you aren't, you're not in ketosis and you're not getting the full benefit.

He very diplomatically pointed out how tough it is being the \"fat kid\" growing up, and how the next few years would decide whether I was picking the girls who I got to date or whether it was the girls picking me to date. We then talked about how it sucks having the self conscious feeling of not wanting to take your shirt off. The physical limitations of being overweight. ", "That was enough for me to realize that I needed to eat properly. Thankfully my weight was never because of a lack of activity, it was just a lack of knowledge on portion control.

I'm not saying bully him into it, but rather explain everything, and tell him that if he wants to do it. You'll help him. But also tell him that if he doesn't want to do it, you won't force him. He needs to know its his choice, and that no matter what you love and support him. But I really think framing it in a way where he gets a rational explanation of how being overweight can negatively affect his life will open his eyes.

(i wish schools did this so badly) you said he doesnt even ask for  the snacks but accepts them, maybe tell him he doesnt always have to accept the snack. again i want to say i think this all needs to be done nicely. i dont believe tough love works well with developing children who have not yet learned certain things. my step sister tried it with my 7yo nephew of our other sister. told him if he didnt lose weight she couldnt love him anymore. really upset a lot of us. he was so upset and took that as \"then i guess i wont eat\" i also had severe anorexia as a child so i suppose thats why im extra cautious/weary of being too hard.

My kids are younger than your brother and I have them on alternating weeks due to a shared custody arrangement. When I cook for them, they have some really odd ideas about food from their mum.

My kids won't willingly eat 5 or 6 various fruit items a day I give them, but if I allow them to choose the 5 or 6 items they eat, that is a bit different and they enjoy browsing the fruit isle for alternatives and spend more time thinking about where food comes from and how it is prepared.", "It's not really a bribe, because I set the framework and guided their choices. For example, I asked my daughter what a good sacrifice would be for that big Lego set and she said she'd give up some xbox time and pay more attention to reading lessons with me...
