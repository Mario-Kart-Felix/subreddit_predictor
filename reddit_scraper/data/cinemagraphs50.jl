Usually the moving part is some small subtle thing in a larger moving scene.  A single person moving slightly on a large campus with grass and trees for example. In this case, the normally quite chaotic crowd has been frozen, and the relatively still part, the frame from a held camera taking a picture of a stage far away, has been made the only movement. I just find that switch very compelling here.", "Awesome job.

Seriously,  I applaud you on that.", "However, something about this doesn't sit well with me. The video shows a lot of crowd movement, light movement, and camera movement which doesn't really explain why everything else in the cinemagraph is perfectly still. IMHO it just seems inconsistent to the point where I can't get into the scene. Anyway, it's always nice to see new ideas in this subreddit and I look forward to your next one.
