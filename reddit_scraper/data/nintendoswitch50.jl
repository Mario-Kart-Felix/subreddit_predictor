", "Let me make a case for how they actually nailed the plot/story in this game and why a more traditional approach might have ruined the game: ", "1) Many of the current open world adventure games, or open-world-like games, provide us their plot through long, drawn-out video segments (typically cut scenes) that aren't interactive, and occur on a linear basis. You complete A, B, and C, then you get a 10 minute video telling you why it's important, or why D, E, and F need to happen next. Then you move on. To me, despite the amazing improvements in making games feel cinematic, this approach restricts the openness, and is incredibly heavy on exposition. ", "BOTW has similar cut-scenes, but they're much more fleeting, and don't need to be seen in order, nor are they required viewing at all really as some of you have pointed out. You might argue that means the game lacks plot, but I think it's a very purposeful narrative tool that allows and requires the player to have a more in-depth point of view on what's going on around them. As you play, you're piecing together a mystery, learning about characters, and realizing the importance of your actions, all tied to the actions you've taken thus far, but never limiting the way you're playing the game. The memories help fit those pieces together. ", "2) One of the primary selling points of BOTW (for me at least) was you can do anything you want, within the constructs of the game, immediately. You can run without armor, weapons, hearts, or stamina straight to the castle and get owned by Ganon. It would be foolish, if not super fun and hilarious, but you can do it. The key to that experience is ignorance, both for you as the player, and for Link as the character. He has nothing, and you have nothing. ", "In other words, giving you and the character the same context makes learning within the game that much more important to the narrative. If you want to take something on that you can't handle, you'll immediately understand that the protagonist is in the exact same position you are. ", "Now, that isn't to say that simply watching each video segment or memory equates to you being \"ready\" to take on Ganon, which brings me to my next point. ", "3) The videos segments or memories feel like they don't directly provide you or Link with much information, nor do they directly bolster your abilities to play the game. That might bother some folks, as it makes them feel inessential, and from a high level might appear to detach the plot from the game play. ", "That said, very purposefully, the context of the memories is entirely dependent on what YOU have done in this open world. They might shed a little light on something you discovered weeks ago, or they might pique your interest in which direction to head on the map next, or they might just make you shrug and move on, but it's mixed in with the overarching themes of the game: ignorance/unpreparedness, exploration/adventure, learning/mastery. ", "You don't need the memories the same way you don't NEED a particular armor set or food recipe, but if you have them, it'll affect the next steps, the next battle, the next piece of the story, whether you realize it or not. At the same time, they won't get in the way. ", "4) The way they've woven the story into the game is also a very clever way of incorporating more of Zelda's personality, importance, and struggles - ultimately raising the stakes on what you're doing. ", "We all know Zelda's general deal in these games, but never has her own journey been so embedded with your own. ", "So yeah - I get the criticism, but I was super tired of playing games that instruct on every single thing to do, and try to squeeze all the emotion into a movie that starts and stops between your 5 minute segments of hand holding gameplay. This felt incredibly fresh, actually open, and still emotionally engaging for me and I think doing the narrative more traditionally, or even more heavily, would have taken away from the experience. ", "TLDR: \n1) This is better than typical narrative games because it's not regimented and doesn't hold your hand through a linear path. \n2) BOTW's narrative devices put you and Link in the same shoes, allowing you to learn simultaneously.\n3) Your own personal gameplay is what drives the story, not the story driving the gameplay \n4) Zelda is a great character and was woven into the game beautifully (imo). ", "I am happy and sad about this. Breath of the wild was great and all but there were things the Oot style Zelda games did that BOTW did poorly. ", "Like the devine beast dungeons felt so weak some of the shrines were more complex then all the dungeons in the game. I know Zelda games were criticized for \"find the item use it to solve the dungeon puzzles\" but I felt that mind set made the dungeons feel more thought out and interesting. Botw's \"find the place to use the Sheikah Slate\" felt boring and was the weakest part of the game.", "And the way they handled the story just felt off. Now Zelda games never had the best story but I felt the older ones had me more invested then Botw. The memories were nice but I feel like there should have been a lot more. And not just about Link and Zelda but about Link and the other champions. Like delve further into Link's and Mipha's relationship, show more of the rivalry between Link and Revali, show Link and Daruk paling around, and show how the hell Link got into Gerudo town the first time and met Urbosa. I feel like there was a lot more they could covered but didn't for some reason or another.", "If they manage to make Botw open world and freedom with Oot/TP dungeons, bosses, music and items, i think we'll have the perfect game.", "I loved BOTW and enjoyed the massive overworld and free exploration.  I would be disappointed though if all Zelda games are  like BOTW in the future.  ", "I want them to keep the open-world/choose your own path style, but I also want more Zelda elements.  I miss unique dungeons, unique items and boss keys.  Dungeons could still award unique items that can be used to discover secrets in the Overworld to encourage Metroid-like exploration, but the items you find in a dungeon wouldn't be required to complete another dungeon.  ", "Also,  I don't want everything I have to break.  I barely ever did shield surfing, because I was tired of my shit breaking.  Once I got a lot of cool weapons, I started skipping bokoblin camps because I didn't want my stuff to break.  I also thought it was lame that some of the special weapons you receive could so easily break, even if there was an option to repair them.", "I am just listing some complaints, but I still love BOTW and it is possibly my favorite Zelda (next to ALTTP).

Normal tablets are portable and the most important functions are entertainment, gaming, and web browsing. None of those functions are actually done super well. Tablet and mobile games are notoriously horrible because of controllers and touch inputs being horrible. Switch doesn't have this problem at all. Entertainment on tablets and mobile isn't as good as it would be on the switch. Web browsing is on the come up for mobile even though it already commands well over 50% of web traffic, but it's still superior to go on the internet with a laptop than any mobile device. Web services isn't a necessity for the switch but it would be nice in my opinion.", "So we have the switch either being generally superior or vastly superior by itself and then you have to factor in being able to go from tablet to on the TV in an instant. That is a HUGE ADVANTAGE for entertainment services compared to other hardware platforms and is a function that is very well suited to wide mainstream adoption. Apple tries to do this with AirPlay but it's not perfect in practice unless you have the full ecosystem of apple stuff everywhere you go. Switch doesn't have that limitation. I can go from my TV trying to binge breaking bad, to going towards the laundromat or airport still on the binge, to back on the TV seamlessly and with no effort. It has a built in kickstand so it's already well suited to being taken anywhere. Plus I guarantee the switch would last a solid 4+ hours on battery if all it's doing is playing a movie.

The story had me going through the motions of collecting stuff without too much of a story to save a princess from a evil that is going to destroy this land and it just became tedious. Don't get me wrong, Zelda has never been known for it's amazing stories. However what Breath of the Wild is lacking compared to other titles in the series is some semblance of a good story that made you care about the characters and the journey they were on.
