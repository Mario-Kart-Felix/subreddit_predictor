It is very important to keep cost down and you have to use off the shelf fasteners most the time.

If the surgical amputation was done in a way where you had better postoperative circulation in the area you might have survived. So, although there are some good reasons you can survive an amputation and have great perfusion in that limb after, the opposite could happen as well. Because of that, I can't say that someone with an amputation has \"normal\" circulation in that area, although (especially with modern surgical techniques) they may well have excellent circulation.

It can starve that flow of blood so that there's not a way to get around fast enough to get into the tissues past the constriction. When that happens, the tissue dies.

A road closure in a neighborhood isn't a big deal because there's a bunch of roads nearby, so it'll really only affect a couple of houses. But if a freeway or an offramp blows up, that entire neighborhood becomes inaccessible.  All the blood (cars) will try to cram into the sidestreets to get in. Of course, it goes slower. A lot slower.

", "Sorry, bad answer I know. Let me break it down. ", "Sugars:", "Sugars are critical. They are what let our cells (and by extension everything else in our body work) now there are a lot of different types of sugars. What we call sugar, aka sweet stuff, can be a different number of them. Glucose, sucrose, glactose, and fructose to name a few, are short chain carbohydrates. Now I'm going to simplify a lot here, but the \"shorter\" the carbohydrate chain the easier to digest. This means they can be digested and turned into energy pretty quickly. But this also means the energy doesn't last too long. ", "Now there are also long chain carbohydrates. Things like rice, wheat, grains, you know, traditional \"carbs\". But basically all fruits and veggies have a mix of short and long chain carbohydrates. Chemically speaking they're still sugars. The difference is that you can't really digest them in the form they're in when you eat them. That's where the difference between \"sugars\" and \"carbs\" comes from. But more on how they differently affect your health later.", "Now the reason these sugars are \"bad\" for you is involved in the digestion  process. Basically, how does it go from your stomach to your blood (and then to individual cells all over the body) basically these things called enzymes are responsible for well, just about everything. Some enzymes break foods down into smaller, more digestible parts (things like meats, and fats, and ", " chain carbohydrates) and some enzymes are responsible for moving these smaller, simpler parts into the blood stream so that they can be delivered to each individual cell to keep it running. Your body produces more or less the same amount of enzymes around the clock. But will try to adjust to meet your needs. So if you need 5000 calories a day (because you're an athlete or something) you will produce more enzymes than someone who only needs 2000. But also the ", " of enzymes produced will vary based on your diet. If you eat a lot of meat, you'll produce more of the enzymes that break down meat. If you eat more grains you'll produce more of the enzymes that break down long chain carbs. ", "So this is where short chain carbs become an issue. Because they're more or less the pure form of dietary energy. They don't need to be broken down much, if at all. Which, side note, is why things with less developed, or no digestive systems LOVE sugar. Single cell organisms are a great example. Things like yeast, which eat sugar and produce alcohol and carbon dioxide, they don't have a mouth or guts, but can still consume ", " short chain carbohydrates with 0 digestive system in place. But I digress. This affects your enzyme production. Because you don't need enzymes that break stuff down, just the ones that move the simple parts to the blood stream.", "A healthy digestive system would work something like this: You eat some food. Your guts start the digestion process. The simple sugars are snapped up right away. The enzymes that break down more complex substances get to work. They can get through maybe 10% of the food an hour (completely guessing on the numbers but it's for the sake of visualization) So every hour 10% more of the food is converted into simple sugars and snapped up by the enzymes that put the simple stuff in the blood stream. Ultimately there's a pretty steady stream of stuff going on. ", "So a high simple sugar consumption causes a few issues. If you get a large amount of your caloric needs from short chain carbs, you'll produce less of the enzymes that break down other food, making it harder on your digestive tract whenever you do eat something else (although probably not by a noticeable amount). But more importantly you'll produce a lot more of the enzymes that more simple parts to the blood stream. The issue with ", " is you don't need that many of those enzymes all the time. If all the simple sugars are in the blood within 30 minutes of eating them, you don't need the enzymes to carry them away to be at max capacity the other 23.5 hours of the day. Unfortunately your body isn't great at making snap changes like that. So it will either under produce the enzymes (in which case you won't digest the sugar properly leading to things like watery stool, low blood sugar (which can cause headaches), and other issues) or, more dangerously, it will over produce those enzymes. This has a number of consequences. But the most important is that it will mean your body will want you to more or less be constantly consuming sweet foods. ", "These factors tend to cause people who eat a lot of sugar to eat a lot more than others, which obviously leads to issues with weight and body fat. There is also the risk of gestational diabetes. Basically it is when an unhealthy woman gets pregnant she can pass on diabetes or a greater risk thereof to the child. It ", " the same as Type 1 (or juvenile onset) diabetes.

Excessive sugar consumption is obviously unhealthy, so it's recommended that women trying to get pregnant avoid excessive sugars, although whether or not it's the sugar or something else in an unhealthy diet is still being studied.", "Also sugar is bad for your teeth. As mentioned above bacteria love sugar. When you eat sweets, sugar ends up on your teeth, bacteria eat the sugar and start to eat at your teeth. They also 'poop' on your teeth, in the form of plaque.", "Salt:", "Salt is important because it allows us to retain water, allows our neurons to send impulses, and just generally lets us do things as large multi cellular organisms. Basically, you need it or you die.", "Why/when is it bad for you?", "Well, salt helps you retain water. It's kind of funny in a morbid sort of way. We need the right amount of it, or we die, but if we eat too much of it, it slowly kills us. So the issue isn't really that we retain water. It's that we retain too much water. When we retain too much water our blood pressure goes up (pretty much always bad), and blood density (or amount of blood cells by volume of blood) goes down (situationally good, but ", "). This puts more strain on your heart, arteries, and kidneys. Once the salt is in your blood it holds water around it, meaning there's more water for blood cells to float around in. This means each pump of the heart delivers less oxygen (which is held in red blood cells) to your other cells. To compensate for less oxygen getting around your arteries tighten which increases your blood pressure. This can cause arterial valves to begin to wear out (usually takes 70-80 year in a healthy person, maybe 40-60 in one who eats too much sugar) once they wear out blood doesn't get delivered properly to those areas. Another thing that can happen is the higher pressure causes the arterial wall to tear. When this happens in the brain we call this a stroke. It's not a good thing no matter where it happens. Also because the pressure is higher it means your heart has to pump harder to move the same amount of blood. Which also causes wear and tear. And when the pressure gets too high, your heart might not be strong enough to push the blood, so it misses a beat, or maybe a few, this is called a heart attack. It can lead to the death of the tissue in the heart and potentially other places in the body if it goes on long enough. Finally it's bad for your kidney's because your kidneys filter it out of your blood. And you're giving your kidneys more work to do. Again, basically just causing wear and tear.", "Fat:", "Okay, let's clear something up right now. Dietary fat is not the same thing as body fat. Eating fat doesn't make you fatter than anything else, calorie for calorie. And this whole dietary group that we're talking about, while called \"fats\" also include oils, and lipids, not just fats. Although basically the only difference between fats and oils is whether or not they're a solid or liquid at room temperature. Lipids are kind of a umbrella term for things that are treated similarly by the body but might not fall into those dietary oils or fats categories. Again, fats are pretty crucial for basic life functions. We get a lot of dietary vitamins and minerals from fats. They also are a pretty crucial material for construction or repair of cells. (So you know, for a kid growing or healing from a paper cut). ", "Here's why fats are unhealthy. Fats tend to be very calorically dense. Meaning bite for bite you're getting a lot more energy from a fatty steak or deep fried something than some fresh vegetables. Again, not a bad thing inherently. This means people tend to eat a lot more of a fatty something before feeling full, so they'll eat much more than they need to. Also there are hundreds if not thousands of types of dietary fats. Some of these fall into a category called \"saturated fats\"  these saturated fats aren't inherently bad for you they don't have the same amounts of the stuff that's good for you as unsaturated fats. Meaning it can lead to a lack of some vitamins or minerals. Or you'll need to eat much more to meet your needs for those vitamins and minerals. Basically the largest risk of fats is that they contain a lot of calories, but may not make you feel as full as something else with a similar amount of calories. So you'll over eat.

Most experiments are incremental advances on previous experiments.  For example, an \"Alzheimer's cure\" might work on clearing amyloid buildup from the brain.  Previous studies might have shown that you remove amyloid with a specific drug.  But the exciting new finding might be that this process of removing amyloid improves scores for rats on a \"memory\" test.

In the above example, although such a finding would be exciting, it was an experiment in an animal.  To get to a human clinical trial that will result in a freely available drug, there's a number of additional steps that would have to be taken.  So while the premise is exciting, there may be hurdles as the drug transitions into humans: maybe the drug doesn't work in humans, maybe it still clears amyloid, but not the kind that is building up in Alzheimer's, or maybe amyloid isn't the real problem in Alzheimer's.  ", "Next, it's important to think about 'as compared to what?'  For example, that magic new diagnostic piece of paper that costs cents to produce/assess and deliver, maybe it only works when you compare people with Alzheimer's to healthy young adults.  When you go and compare old people with and without Alzheimer's maybe the paper doesn't do as great of a job of returning positive results only for people with Alzheimer's.  ", "And finally, when people describe things that can be made \"for only\" $X, they don't really consider all the additional costs that are incurred to bring products to market.  The reason Epipens are costly has nothing to do what the actual process of a single use spring-loaded injectable.  It has to do with the quality control, manufacturing, and subsequent clinical testing that was performed, along with the patent registration and defense.  Those things cost money, and that money is recouped by the manufacturer in the cost of the item.    So while it is straightforward for young scientists and engineers to come up with novel solutions, they often don't have the financial backing to bring these types of products to market, nor are they often aware of their process infringing upon existing patents.

The longer you live and the more your cells divide, the greater likelihood that a mutation occurs. However, there isn't just one gene that causes every single cancer out there--cancer is often a complex conglomeration of factors unique to each individual or population subset. Some genes may be mutated in one type of cancer, while others may be changed in other types. And I'm not talking about he location of the cancer--a cancer in one part of the body can spread to many other parts--I'm talking about the genetic mutations in the site. Since cancer grows uncontrollably, the likelihood for mutation is increased, leading to an increased likelihood for survival (in the same vein as evolution/natural selection). Even in the same tumor, cancer cells can have a different genotype from each other. In that sense, finding a cure for cancer is like battling the hydra--every time you cut off one head (i.e., attack a certain target), two more heads emerge. Saying that we will have a universal cure to cancer is like saying that we will have a cure to all bacterial infections existence, which is a ridiculous statement. \nWhen people talk about cures for cancer, they usually refer to very specific treatments for a specific type of cancer (i.e. rare childhood cancers).

It's like the difference between identifying that the moon orbits the Earth and actually going to the moon. \nFurthermore, clinical trials for diseases like Alzheimer's tend to be very difficult and expensive, since such studies usually require monitoring the same subjects for many years.

What happens when potty training is that toddlers are learning to associate the feelings of a full bladder/bowel with the imminent arrival of pee, and control the muscles around the urethra to hold it long enough to get to a toilet first. Children sleep much more deeply than adults - they tend to sleep through noise, for example, much more easily - and it's common that for some time during and after potty training they are either not aware enough of the nerve endings around the bladder to pay attention to them even during sleep or they are just too deeply asleep to notice these sensations.

When we do, it's likely unusual enough that this is a significant factor as well. For children who haven't started producing this hormone yet (the exact age varies, but girls tend to develop it a couple of years earlier than boys, which is why boys are more likely to suffer from bedwetting for longer), the feeling of having a full bladder at night wouldn't necessarily be unusual meaning it's less likely to wake the child up.", "Lastly there is the simple fact that adults tend not to be afraid of the dark and additionally are much more aware of where their limit for ", " peeing themselves is, whereas children might delay getting out of bed because they are cold, scared, or just sleepy and they don't have as good of a handle on that tipping point yet because they don't have as much experience.

Short answer: immaturity of pathways in the central nervous system. Long answer:  At the beginning of life we don't have voluntary control of our sphincters, the ring shaped muscles that allow or deny the expulsion of urine or excrement. When we acquire control varies but usually happens between 2 and 4 years of age. Nocturnal control also involves the ability to wake up and regain control of the body. When we are asleep and are dreaming motor activity is blocked from the rest of the body to avoid acting out the dream. If this doesn't happen you get a sleep walker. If you wake up but the block doesn't go away you may be semi conscious but can't move. A lot of these usually go away within a normal time frame but there are teens that the signal to wake up is not sent still and have to be woken up or they will wet the bed.

I have gone to sleep more times and had the urge to go more times. I just have more practice at it. ", "Because we're all seasoned to know what it feels like to piss ourselves. In other words,  \"we already know what it is\". ", "From what I've been able to find to answer your question OP, it seems like it's a matter of your brain and your bladder maturing and learning to communicate better. Most adults simply don't need to urinate at night, (or they can hold their bladder until morning). if an adult needs to pee at night, their bladder sends a signal through the nervous system to the brain, and they will usually feel the need to get out of bed and relieve themselves or the brain will tell the bladder not to release itself until the person is ready to get up. Children don't begin to get this signal until around mid-childhood. \nIt could also be because of a hormone called Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH). In bed wetters, the amount of ADH produced in the evening time is found to be lower. It's a chemical that signals to your kidneys how much water to retain. If the amounts in your bloodstream are too low, you're body will produce to much urine at night. Children (and adults!) who don't produce enough ADH may end up wetting the bed, especially if they're deep sleepers. It's more or less bladder control, and your brain and bladder communicating more clearly with each other. Children just don't have the same signals and cues as adults do. Some outside factors can cause it, including UTI's, injury, constipation, diabetes, and stress. Hope this helps! Sorry if it's a bit confusing! But it's not one single thing that causes bedwetting in children or adults. Not all children wet the bed, and it can even sometimes be caused by genetics if the child has parents or close relatives who also wet the bed at their age.  The problem usually goes away on its own as the child gets older, and their bladders expand and their brain begins sending the right signals. \nEdit: TL;DR - Children usually wet the bed due to a variety of factors that can include stress, hormone production, illness, bladder control, and genetics but mostly it's because adults get signals to their brain from their bladder and the brain will simply wake the person to urinate, or tell the bladder not to release itself until the person gets up. Children don't get the same signals, and have smaller bladders, and therefore do not wake up just because they need to go, or they might simply be deep sleepers and when the bladder becomes too full they simply just don't wake up.  Some people don't produce enough of a chemical that causes the production of urine to slow at night, and combine that with a child's small bladder and poor bladder control, and viola, bedwetting can happen. Children usually begin to receive the signal around mid-childhood (9-11 years old), and most children will grow out of bedwetting simply with age. ", "Like anything else - practice. Though this is subconscious.", "Think of it this way. A child's body has not dealt with a bloated bladder before. The default response has been 'let go'.", "Adult bodies know what this means. We've peed ourselves before and don't want to again. The body doesn't want to; it makes us cold and uncomfortable. So adult bodies tell the brain ", "Children have more active and deep dream cycles.

The Consuls each commanded an army, and many generals were given legal authority over generalship (Imperium), but again no general could wage war without the Consuls or the Senate's (composed of retired Consuls) approval.

The Republic lasted for a long time because anybody who gained too much power was kept in check by the Consuls and Senate.

These requirements were immensely expensive, and so only the extraordinarily wealthy could hold this amount of power; the power remained to specific families and persons, and those with power now had personal armies which they could utilize to their own desires. This permitted Sulla, Marius' own underling, to do what none other had done before; Sulla's soldiers respected him so much more than the state that they followed his command to march on Rome. Sulla had been denied a right to wage war for political reasons, and he held Rome hostage until he acquired it. This set the stage for Caesar, who did the same, and then the Emperors, who were titled Imperator (commander-in-chief).

It's  ultimately a problem of brain structure.", "There's two types of learning relevant to this discussion, auditory learning and vocal learning. Auditory learning is the simple ability to associate sounds with meanings. Chimps and birds are both capable of this, as is your dog when he \"sits\" on command. The more difficult task is vocal learning which is the ability to mimic sounds an animal has heard. This is actually a pretty rare skill, exhibited by only five mammalian classes (bats, cetacenas, elephants, sea lions and humans) and 3 avian classes (parrots, songbirds and hummingbirds) (Simonyna, Howitz & Jarvis, 2012). The vast majority of other animals, unequipped with the ability for vocal learning, are only capable of producing those sounds innately encoded in their genome, usually primitive grunts, screeches, etc. Although the process of repeating a sound seems simple, it requires unique neurological hardware and is not a simple extension of normal auditory and motor faculties. Jarvis' lab and others have been trying to map out these circuits in avian brains, which show unique gene expression (eg ZENK up-regulation). Again, vocal learning is not a natural extension of higher cortical processes; it requires special circuitry developed via evolution, not across an animal's lifetime.", "Together, auditory learning and vocal learning are considered the \"substrate for language.\" Language requires both processes. Without vocal learning, an animal cannot vocalize \"learned\" sounds. It's stuck with the sounds it was born knowing. Without auditory learning, an animal cannot associate new meanings to novel sounds. It's stuck with the associations it was born understanding. Combined, these forms of learning allow an animal to associate sounds with meaning and repeat those sounds, to \"speak.\" To be clear, when a chimp uses sign language, it is using motor learning (ie copying another chimp's physical movements), which is vastly different than vocal learning (copying sounds). I cannot comment on differences between each animal's vocal apparatus, but even if they were all the same, most animals' brains would still be the limiting factor. ", ": This is its own field of study. It is due to a difference in the animal's brains, specifically the presence/absence of circuits designed for vocal learning. Vocal learning is the unique ability to learn how to mimic sounds an animal has heard. Across the animal kingdom only 8 classes developed this ability and they are from vastly different origins, separated by as much as 65-300 million years of evolution, implying that they achieved this skill convergently. ", "See this 5 minute video for a more comprehensive introduction to the subject: ", "I'm an anthropologist, so I actually don't know about the birds.  But chimps can't articulate language properly not because of their brains (they learn sign language quite well, indicating that there are no major cognitive issues) or really their lips, but because of the position of their voice box (larynx).  In humans, the voice box is very low in the throat, allowing the space above the voice box to be a resonating chamber for sound.  In chimps, the voice box is quite high, making it impossible for them to produce the full range of human sounds.", "As an interesting side note, babies have high voice boxes too.  As they grow, the voice box drops lower, allowing them to produce the full range of human sounds.

Many different structures can create he same sound. Ever see an electric guitarist (e.g. Frampton) make his guitar talk?

I recently started writing down the English phrases one of my macaws uses and it ended up two pages long. These are phrases he understands and uses correctly in communication - not just mimicry. For example about an hour ago he was eating some grapes, he turned to me and said \"want some of this?\" and threw a grape at me. Seriously. ", "Answer from a paleoanthropologist: it's not about the lips, rather, it's about the hyoid bone morphology (this bone is at the back of the throat) and the supralaryngeal vocal tract dimensions. When these things are the right size, it allows enough space for bending of the air (with the tongue) to produce sound. Chimps, for example, do not have enough space in their SVT to produce as many sounds as humans can. Language is not understood well, physiologically, beyond this. ", "You are asking a set of complex questions. I'll try to break it down.", "Birds in general are adepts in producing and imitating sounds. They communicate exclusively with sound and far less by visual stimuli. Thus one can expect their vocal boxes are highly evolved.

Now uncompressed audio takes up a lot of space and can be slow to transfer, so to reduce it down to something more manageable, phone systems use something called a CODEC (en", "de/", "ode) that basically analyses the audio, and throws out the bits of data that it thinks is not relevant to the clarity of the conversation.

Europe uses a variation of it called A-LAW. It allows 64Kbp/s of data for each way of the conversation (So 128Kbp/s total). It's been around since the 70's and is fairly embedded into most phone systems. It also closely matched and fitted the best data rate offered by twisted copper connections that where used at the time (And predominantly still are).", "The days of the \"AM radio\" phone call are coming to an end though, if quite slowly.", "Many new codecs have been developed alongside newer communications technology since the 70's that allow for greater clarity in a phone conversation. They do this by improved methods of packing in the audio data and more sophisticated ways of deciding what parts of the audio need to be thrown away and what needs to be kept. Some are even able to do this using a smaller transfer speed than the U-LAW codec. Most of these improved quality codecs are referred to as wideband codecs or \"HD audio\". This has come about with the rise of a technology called VOIP or \"Voice Over IP\" which is basically a phone system that utilizes the same technology that underpins the internet (TCP/IP) to deliver an all digital phone service.", "One of the most popular codecs used by internal phone systems of companies/organizations (Which is sometimes referred to as a PBX or Private Branch Exchange) is a codec called G722.

So if a phone conversation is initiated between two phone systems, one side tries to use a wideband codec like G722 and the other side only supports U-LAW, then both phones will use U-LAW and the conversation will return to the \"AM Radio\" quality for both callers.", "The history of the telephone began with Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) which simply refers to the old, analog phone system we used for the first 100 or so years. Although humans (young ones anyways) can hear a range of frequencies between 20hz and 20,000hz, the vast majority of human speech is well below 4,000hz. The original designers of the POTS system designed what became known as a standard Voice Grade Channel (VGC) with practical limits due to the way electronic circuits worked so a standard VGC was typically 300hz to 3,400hz. When we switched to digital telephones they simply continued that standard by digitally sampling voice and consuming that same amount of bandwidth.  Fun fact. I worked with digital, encrypted telephones when I was in the Air Force and depending on the quality of the phone line and the bandwidth available, the encrypted phone would start at 4,000hz bandwidth and throttle to a smaller bandwidth if it couldn't maintain synchronization. At half that standard bandwidth or 2,000hz the quality of the speech reduced so you wouldn't recognize your own mom. At half again of that or 1,000hz you could barely understand it and could not recognize male from female speakers on the other end", "To save on bandwidth, many of the audio codec compresses in a lossy format to squeeze more active calls simultaneously. There are lots of phone in a given region, and there's never enough capacity to carry all the phones calling at the same time. ", "There's also the problem that if you don't have at least a bit of noise on the phone, people think it is not working, so even if you are in a quiet room calling another phone in a quiet room, you're likely to hear some white noise to help you differentiate between an active call with silence on the line vs a phone without an active call.

So they added the noise back manually.", "If you call a Cisco (or other) digital VOIP phone within the same network/building, it's so crystal clear, it's like the other person is standing next to you.  It's actually kind of unsettling because it doesn't sound like a \"phone\" anymore.", "Short short answer, is bandwidth efficiency.", "Back in the day, prior to mobile communications, telephony was 'circuit switched'. This meant that when communicating from point A to point B, dedicated resources would be assigned on all the equipment between. As there was always a limit to the amount of resources available, the algorithms used to compress voice into transmittable data favoured very high compression over voice quality. If the number of calls exceeds the available resources, then calls are not connected.", "You can imagine this like the old style telephone operators connecting calls. If there were more calls than operators, some calls wouldn't be connected.", "The internet, and data networks, are packet switched. This means that rather than reserving dedicated resources between two endpoints, the resources are shared. The upshot of this is that when resources are highly available, you get very high performance. As the resources drop the performance for all drops, but the communications continues for all (albeit at a lower rate).", "Now lets fast forward to mobile communications. You'd think it's all packet switched right? Well, no. Mobile telephony was built as a concept long before data transmissions to mobile phones was considered. As a result, mobile phone calls were always (and in almost all cases still are) circuit switched. As a result of this, and the fact that earlier radio technologies (2G/3G) had much lower available bandwidth high compression algorithms (codec's) are mainly used.", "Now, in 2G and 3G mobile telephony, the codec's used are AMR (Adaptive Multi Rate) and AMR-WB (Adaptive Multi Rate Wide Band - otherwise known as HD Voice).", "The Adaptive Multi Rate codecs are pretty clever, as they can scale their quality/efficiency based on the available bandwidth. With 2G and 3G radio's, bandwidth is directly related to signal strength. So as the signal strength drops, the quality drops.", "Now lets move up to today, and 4G. Unlike 2G and 3G radio's, the bandwidth of 4G isn't directly related to the signal strength, and as a result can maintain higher quality calls at weaker signal strengths.", "Additionally, where with 2G and 3G data is transmitted as a packet switched network over the circuit switched bearer, with 4G it's an entirely packet switched network and the voice (know as VoLTE, Voice over LTE) is carried out exactly like a VoIP phone (although the technical specs elaborate on is massively).", "However, almost all carriers that deploy 4G, use 'Circuit Switched Fallback' for voice, meaning that when placing or receiving a phone call the mobile phone falls back to 2G or 3G to connect the call. This is mainly because most carriers haven't yet deployed VoLTE.", "The combinations of these technologies mean that when you connect a call using AMR-WB over 4G (VoLTE), it supports higher bandwidth modes than over 3G, so you get even better quality. Sadly VoLTE isn't widely deployed, and even HD voice on 3G isn't that widely deployed, and when you call up your friend it doesn't matter if your phone/carrier supports the top end voice codec's if the other end is stuck on a circuit switched (2G/3G or fixed line) connection.", "Credentials: Telephony Consultant, specialising in VoLTE and Fixed Line IMS\nEdit: Grammar, spelling and some expanded information on the lack of VoLTE service worldwide", "Let me shine here for a while: at the moment in the US and in the World the mobile networks still widely use 20+ years old standards for voice calls: 2G (GSM) and 3G (CDMA, WCDMA). They are still following the same voice codecs created and standartized for handset (phone) equimpent in late 80s (GSM) and mid 90s (CDMA/WCDMA). In order to keep old equipment still able to use modern network, they do not switch of completely such dinosaur codecs as HR, FR, AMR and are unable to replace them by more modern.

Our brain fills in the sounds it expects to hear based upon what it has heard before.  So, much like Compact Disc worked by filtering out certain frequencies so that huge amounts of information could be squeezed onto a format which could only store around 750MB of data, the telephone system is also designed to carry ", " sound information, so that our ears can reconstruct what they expect to hear in an ordinary human voice.  ", "To demonstrate this to your own satisfaction, you could ask someone you're talking with to play music over the phone.  The quality quickly dips into an indiscernible mess, because there's too much sound information for the digital converter software running on the telephone company's computers to process it in such a way that it fits into the available bandwidth.  However, as anyone who has ever been placed on-hold will tell you, the muzak which plays is clear enough to listen to (albeit for only a short amount of time, before losing your mind).  This is because it has been ", " electronically so that it only takes up the same space which would ordinarily be used by the human voice, meaning that the telephone network effectively ", " it as such.", "The reason the networks do this is down to costs.  You can squeeze many more separate point to point phone calls down a single fiberoptic cable if none of the data which would be necessary for a full HD quality stream is included.  To get around this HD Voice systems tend to rely on the user's handset to do the encoding and decoding which would have traditionally been performed by the phone company's equipment.  This is only possible because it uses the increased processing power now available on modern smart phones, but it tends to introduce a slight delay because the software running on both phones 'waits' for enough information to reconstruct a clear sound before sending it down the line.  This delay can be negligible if you and the person you're talking to are geographically close to one another, but it becomes noticeably worse if you're making an international call - where the delay is similar to those which cause problems for live satellite link-up TV news reports.", "I read all the comments so far and didn't see one thing that's very important for sound quality: the electric to sound transducer, the \"speaker\" at the end of the chain.", "Your phone sounds like an AM radio because the speaker is built like an AM radio. It has a very small membrane that vibrates, it cannot reproduce bass sounds well because it's too small.

If anything, there is less demand than ever for high definition audio calling as texting has replaced a lot of calling. ", "A long time ago when previous generation phone networks were being built, there was very limited capacity in the system so a decision was made to only allow X amount of that capacity per call.  This way the system could carry more calls that sounded \"OK\" vs a fewer number of calls that sounded \"Good\".  It was simply a compromise toward capacity vs performance.", "These days, there are actually quite a lot of scenarios where that no longer applies and calls should sound much better.  For instance, an end to end VoIP call that doesn't traverse the public telephone network (PSTN) at all.  Think of Skype, Google Hangouts, Ventrio, Teamspeak, an internal call at a business using a VoIP phone system, etc.  Those calls will generally sound much better than a standard phone call transiting the PSTN because they can use much more bandwidth.  Of course, this is assuming that the IP network in between the two endpoints is performing well, has relatively low latency/jitter, and has sufficient available bandwidth.", "VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is something a lot of cell phone companies have now, which basically uses VoIP behind the scenes.  This only works when the entire call path is on a compatible network (i.e. if you call a PSTN phone from your VoLTE-compatible cell phone, you're not getting VoLTE end to end so you're not going to get the better call quality, but if you called another cell VoLTE-compatible cell phone on the same carrier you should).", "Some parts of the PSTN are better than others.  For instance, many businesses use ISDN or SIP instead of regular analog phone lines (like what you'd typically have at your home) and these are both digital technologies.  So, in some circumstances, even a call you place over the PSTN could be digital end to end, and that call will typically sound better than a call that's transiting an analog network, although it usually won't sound as good as a VoIP call.", "Many people have commented on bandwidth and codec issues which is true but voice communication has one more aspect that is important to mention. Latency... Voice communication can't be delayed too long otherwise it's physically difficult to actually have a conversation with the other party. You won't be able to accurately gauge when somebody is genuinely pondering a response or just delayed and will talk over each other more frequently. This disrupts the whole flow of the conversation and your ability to think, listen, and understand and share information effectively.

In order to keep the transmissions efficient, they created compression systems that were optimized for the human voice.", "Think of the way MP3s take up less space than WAV files.  Basically they strip out information from the audio that won't make a big difference to how you hear the sound.  Now, if you wanted to make an MP3-like format to be as efficient as possible for the human voice, you could strip out sound frequencies that aren't used in voices.  The deepest bass drum and the highest-pitch flute make sound frequencies that the human voice generally don't, so if you're not interesting it making nice-sounding musical files, you can just strip those frequencies out.", "Also, there are some frequencies that the human voice makes that aren't very important to making it easy to understand what people are saying.  If you have a very deep voice, for example, you can strip out the low-pitched sounds and people will still be able to understand the words you're saying.  So if you want to save bandwidth, strip out all those frequencies too.", "So that's what they did.  They stripped out all of the information that wasn't necessary to understand the words people are saying.  It saved a lot of space, but it made people sound like they were being transmitted over AM radio.  Worse, actually.  Ever notice that if music is playing over your cell phone call, it just sounds like garbage and noise?  It's stripping out all of the frequencies that are important for music, but not important for understanding speech.", "Now, bandwidth is less of an issue, but phone carries still want to save bandwidth where they can.  Also, people aren't really demanding better quality.  Also, the carriers have taken a long time to agree on what the new phone compression should be and how it should work, and the way they compress the audio has to match between carriers, or else you'll lose quality in the conversion.", "Audio needs physical dimensions to be properly payed back. You phone is small. ", "Historical reasons are different and are about bandwidth; both for making the audio more intelligible in our small devices and to also carry more signal thru wires. These days bandwidth is less of a concern and codec using 128kbps sounds perfectly ok even in the most \"audiophile\" of systems. But your phone is still small. At best, it can do 250Hz at low end. If we try to put more, we will only get distortion: if we use wider signal than the system can take, it will only turn in to intermodulation distortion and heat. A bit like trying to send plastic balls thru a tube, put too much of them there and some of the balls start to be crushed and are not round anymore. So our signal has to be smaller than the pipe it goes thru. Same requirements are in dynamic range as in frequency response; both consume bandwidth and the devices we use have VERY narrow range in both. .We have maybe 12-18dB to play with where as your stereo system can have 90dB dynamic range or more.", "And the whole system has to operate on the lowest common denominator; we have to use the \"worst\" phones as the quality level, we are not talking about details but just \"can you understand me with any device you happen to have\"..

Something you may not realize is that all your wireless communications are traveling at the speed of light because they're being sent on light waves (that your eyes can't see). When people say they want a 'faster' connection, what they mean is that they want more bandwidth. You can think of bandwidth as the number of lanes on a highway, all the cars (information) are traveling at the maximum speed (speed of light) so the only way to pass more cars through our highway is to increase the number of lanes.

Just imagine how annoying it'd be if you were watching TV and suddenly you started picking up people's cell phone conversations. In order to serve all the people making calls in the area, the tower needs to allocate that bandwidth in a smart way.

Not only does the power help with clarity, but a hi-fi receiver will have audio processing capabilities a cell phone will not.

The higher efficiency (easier to move) and less ohms (lower power transfer resistance) of the driver, the cleaner the audio will sound. ", "Remember when I said my receiver was 9.2? That means 11 speakers including subwoofers, and is expandable to 13 (denon x6200w for those curious). People have that many speakers (for surround sound and) because some are better at handling highs- like your center channel which handles mostly verbal dialogue, and your subwoofer- which handles bass aka the lows. You could never get the range and clarity of sound (audios version of 4k video) out of one speaker, and certainly not a tiny 1/2\" speaker. I don't want to say it's impossible, but to get that clear, crisp, and deep sound I'm talking about the drivers have to move a lot of air.

(See previous example of Albert and Simon eating junk food) -- anything that goes into a black hole is gone forever.... Kind of. The metaphor I like best is to think of an encyclopedia and all the knowledge it contains. Throwing it into a black hole is like throwing it into a furnace...

You're not going to have a closed system where the 500g thing becomes 700g without some outside interference, and you're not going to have 1kg which becomes 800g without sending that mass somewhere.", "If those things could happen, our whole universe would be weird and unstable and wouldn't work the way we observe it to.", "So the next thing that we realized was a little more about the nature of matter and of relativity.  Essentially that mass and energy are essentially the same things.  So that leads to understanding things like processes that convert mass to energy like radiation or nuclear fission.  So it means that mass isn't necessarily conserved, but the combination of mass and energy is. As we learned more, we started the find more ways that energy is kind of kept in stuff.  It's more than just the kind of energy that we think about that pushes things around, it's also responsible for properties of everything.", "I mean, if you have something like fission and one atom can turn into two different atoms, plus a lot of energy, there's more than just the mass of those atoms and the energy, there's also the fact that they ARE those atoms and those photons, and not some other configuration.  We also know for it to change between one configuration and another might take or release energy from the system, so there's actually energy IN that configuration. ", "So what we decided was that hey, we've said that mass is energy, and energy is energy, and something is configured in such a way that some of this stuff stays stuck together, and some of has no rest mass and can't stay in one place.  But we're sick of just calling everything energy, because that's misleading.  So we'll call ALL of this stuff information. Information is the mass, and the energy, and the way it's configured, and a whole bunch of stuff about it. ", "So the thing is information is conserved, of course it can change, but the amount of it is always still around.  So you have some fission and that information defines the initial state and the end state and it's the same amount of information. ", "But the problem is with black holes.  Black holes as they're generally thought of essentially break time.  We know when we have fission, that at point A we have so much information, and at point B after they've undergone fission, we have the same amount of information, but it describes a different system (with its resulting products and energy) ", "But in black holes it's kind of like we have point A, and point B will never exist because time stops working properly in the black hole. ", "So this kind of breaks how we think of the universe.  If we had 100 units of information before, and it falls into a black hole, and we will never have any information again from that, then it's not being conserved.  If that's the case, the universe shouldn't have really got started the way we think it did.", "What Hawking discovered was that black holes emit radiation.  Radiation is information.  ", "What happens is first there's nothing.  Then out of nothing you get two things, one is some information, and the other is a debt for that amount of information.  It's kind of like you have some flat ground, and you make a hole.  You don't make any more dirt, you've just made a hole, and another area you've made it a pile.  Now that can just happen anywhere, but the dirt will just fall back into the hole, because you're not \"actually\" doing anything, you're not doing any work, you're just saying to the ground \"This part is the pile, and the empty part around it is the hole\"  ", "But sometimes what happens is that the black hole incorporates things, sometimes it just gets the hole, and the dirt stays behind.  (now it can't just get the dirt and miss the whole for reasons that exceed the analogy)  Then the black hole, which is a giant pile, has a bit of itself fall into that little hole that it incorporated.  This continues to happen until the giant pile is flat and the black hole disappears.", "So that kind of explains the life cycle of a black hole, but there's still a bunch of information that gets into the black hole but doesn't get out.  With the hole and pile explanation here, you're creating new dirt, and destroying a piece of the pile in the black hole, which still has a bit of a problem because things still only really make sense when information doesn't get created and destroyed.  ", "So instead the idea is kind of like all of that information in the black hole sits right on the edge.  When those holes get pulled in, what gets left behind is a bit of that information that went in.  Now it's all messed up beyond any recognition, but it's the same stuff as went in.  You can't tell what went in by looking at what came out (unlike the fat albert analogy) but if you knew what went in, and you looked at what came out, you could confirm that what came out was some potential configuration of what went in. ", "A better conclusion to the Fat Albert analogy is that Albert eats all of those candies, and you think, Oh dear, those candies have to go somewhere. They can't just stop existing.   But as Fat Albert moves around and you observe him from outside of the range that he's going to eat you, you smell stinky farts, and little piles of poop on the ground.  You know that on some level those gasses and poops were once your beloved candies, but they're different now.

This just takes a very very long time.", "A turns into B... eventually.

Matter (and in this instance we think of it as information) can neither be created nor destroyed. It can change forms, become energetic particles, can behave like waves, but it can't simply blink out of existence. Black holes consume matter, and their gravity is so high, and gravity well so deep, that everything they pull in is effectively lost forever, IE destroyed. In a manner of speaking, it's no longer a part of the universe and plays no more role in it. One of Hawkings original ideas of how this might work included what we now call Hawking radiation. That because of the way matter behaves at a small scale, it is theoretically possible for matter to escape a black hole along the event horizon and it escapes in the form of Hawking radiation. What this means in laymans terms is that over time, black holes will evaporate, releasing mass back into the universe in the form of energy. But it's not released back in the form of helium, hydrogen, or other elements that were consumed so in a way it's still not possible to tell whats actually inside a black hole. The new idea seems to be that when the devoured matter crosses the event horizon, it leaves tell tale traces that are captured in the event horizon and that if the event horizon were better understood and analyzed, it may be theoretically possible to tell what passed through it. IE a record of what was destroyed. It's an interesting idea. ", "My \"analogy\" of sorts is this: a star emits light which beams down onto you and casts a shadow.

This involves stops at a lot of bus stops. To get on the bus, you have to have your tickets stamped with the current station (departing), the next station (arriving), and your final destination across the country. ", "Each time you get to a bus station, you must provide the attendant with your current ticket in exchange for a new ticket. The new ticket still has the same final destination, but now has a new departing station and arriving station. The old tickets are put in a cabinet to be stored.", "A theft decides that he wants to rob you since he knows you're not at your home. He doesn't know where you live, but he does have access to every single old bus ticket from across the country.", "To figure out where you came from, he looks at the ticket you used to get off the train at your final destination. This ticket tells him the station you came from before arriving at your final destination. Since he now knows your 2nd from last stop, he looks up that ticket. He keeps looking up tickets to find the 3rd, 4th, 5th from last stops until he finally finds the stop at your house.", "It works well until he gets to the 10th stop. At the 10th stop, they think keeping old tickets is a waste of time so they throw them all out immediately. Robber now has no way of getting to your house because he can't find your ticket - breaking the chain back to your house.", "Since the robber is lazy he gives up at this point.", "That's the end of the question OP asked. He's a continuation showing how sleuth's might work around the \"lost ticket\" problem.", "If the robber was dedicated, he would try to go the landfill to find the discarded ticket. He's unlikely to find anything because it's been raining and all of the tickets have turned to mush.", "His last options is to look for your ticket at every station that provides service to the 10th station. There are a looooooooot of stations that provide service to the 10th station so he can't simply look at every ticket from every station.  He's a smart robber, so he only looks for routes in the time frame he knows you arrived at the 10th station. He finds 5 possible routes you took. ", "Since he really wants to break into your house, he goes to all 5 of the routes and by a stroke of luck finds your ticket (EDIT: Important to note, he has a bit of help because he finds only one ticket with the same final destination as yours). He can once again find your house and rob you.", "Basically, tickets are much like packets. They carry a partial story about where you're traveling too but don't necessarily show where you came from (VPN's, proxies, NAT, etc). If you can follow each step of the chain back, you can find out where something came from. In certain cases, the chain might be broken. You either need to get a bit lucky or find another way to connect the chain.", "EDIT 2: Obligatory thanks for the gold!", "This is a pretty difficult one to thoroughly ELI5. My explanation explains only the simplest of simple (i.e. one layer of protection - VPN).", "The true issue gets compounded when you factor in crazy things like:", "Anonymity is achieved in practice using VPNs and multiple proxies. These are two different techniques but they can be combined.", "A VPN is a special kind of proxy that allows many people to appear to have the same IP address which makes it very difficult for anyone (except the VPN's owner) to figure out who connects to where. VPNs can and often are used for other purposes and may not even anonymize your connection, but for the purpose of this discussion I will talk about those VPNs which are designed to hide your connection by communicating with you only using encrypted messages and by merging more user connections through the same IP address.", "Tracking users is difficult, but not impossible. You have a bunch of incoming transmissions and a bunch of outgoing transmissions and you correlate the timings. If after long observation you notice that every time someone connects to a website someone in the VPN is connecting to something, then you can say with more or less certainty which user of the VPN connects to that website. In practice, this is expensive and takes a lot of time, so it's only used to track certain users. Copyright enforcers don't want to invest resources in this because their only evidence in court would be a strong correlation between a user's connection to a VPN and that VPN's connection to a host. On the other hand, some three letter US agencies invest in this kind of correlation because it gives them enough evidence to gather more evidence. If you're doing bad things online, you will be discovered.", "It's also worth noting that a couple of VPN encryption methods were just declared ineffective, so a lot of traffic can now be monitored until VPN providers reconfigure their software to use better encryption.", "The Tor proxy does something similar, but it actually uses a chain of proxies. This makes it difficult in practice for three letter agencies to track you down because they need to collaborate with other jurisdictions. The way the chain of proxies is built is geographical. You will go through foreign countries on opposite sides of the world because these countries collaborate less with each other.", "Then, there are Tor hidden services. These can only be accessed using Tor proxy chains which make it difficult to find where they are physically located. This provides even more anonymity. The hidden service chains are also longer than regular chains.", "And finally, there are other solutions - like Freenet - which act only similarly to Tor hidden services but also keep content distributed on the users' computers so it doesn't get taken down even if the original server is found and disconnected from the network. The more people use it, the more information can be stored on the network and the faster content can be delivered.", "On top of technology, there's also the human element. To maintain anonymity you must act like the average user of your group (you must blend in) so you can't be tracked by your writing style or any other drops of personal information you might leave behind. The human element is crucial to maintaining anonymity.", "Imagine you are in the busiest city in the world with the largest population.  The only mode of transportation are yellow cabs.  Everyone has to use one for everything to from A to B.  Now if someone just uses one cab to go from A to B its easy since its the same taxi service, same driver, same everything.  ", "This would allow tracking and following you relatively easy since all you have to do is ask the taxi service in this case your ISP where that cab went.  ", "Now if I change cabs multiple times going from A to B someone would have to ask multiple drivers, cab companies, for any details.  ", "Now lets say I took multiple cabs to the border of the next city whose laws are much different that the riding laws of the previous ctiy.  Maybe that next city doesn't collect data on my destination or doesn't share that information.  Hell maybe they dont like each other and tell the other city to screw off (imagine US to China).  This would make it damn near impossible to track.", "Apply this logic to how packets hop and there ya go.", "Like ", " said, the way a VPN or TOR works means that you connect to one server (the VPN server or the first TOR node) and then all your traffic goes through that. Your traffic also uses strong encryption between your computer and the server you're connected to, which means nobody can intercept and read that traffic. ", "Because of these two factors, it's only easy to say \"this VPN is connected to this website\" and unless the VPN provider keeps logs (or otherwise provides information saying which user accessed which website and when), there's no way to trace it back to you. With TOR, if you set it up properly, nothing can really trace back to you because there are so many different servers that you connect through: if the first server in the path keeps logs, the next one probably won't, and the one after that won't, and so on.", "Now, it's important to note that this anonymity only works because so many people are using the same server as you. If you run your own VPN, that doesn't actually provide any anonymity: since you're the only person using it, any traffic that comes from it can be traced back to you. ", "Let's ", " ELI5 it...", "TOR:", "The ISP is a letter carrier.  They'll pass your letter on to your network of super secretive friends who will ultimately send it to its destination and get the response for you.  Yes, they have the power to read that letter, but you and your friends are smart - you talk in code that nobody else can translate.  ", "The real destination for your letter is actually written inside where nobody can see, and you and your friends readdress and send your letter to each other a handful of times to confuse anybody at the post office who might be paying attention to ", " the mail is going.", "In fact, even if a letter is known to have been sent by you - even if you wrote it yourself, you can still plausibly deny it, and say you were just passing it on for someone else.", "VPN:", "Same as above, but there's only one friend ever helping you, making the whole operation a bit shit in comparison.  You talk in code to him and he does your bidding on your behalf. If he gets caught though, there's no telling what might happen.  Depends how much he decided to write down about you.", "TOR has been mentioned a lot and it's a useful step, but if you're picturing a serious hacker doing bad deeds from their home internet connection that's probably not realistic. The world is swimming in internet access points. There's no reason to use one that's registered to you. So what's the main reason you wouldn't get tracked back to your isp? Because you wouldn't be dumb enough to use your isp.", "A careful hacker's setup would start with finding a machine you can pay cash for that has a network card that allows you to spoof it's MAC address. You would prefferably get this off Craigslist or some other camera free situation. Running this machine from a read only OS like tails is an additional step you might take to avoid leaving evidence on the laptop.", "Now you'd want to choose an access point you can connect to without being filmed. Wifi passwords are pretty easy to steal so this could be a public or private access point. Spoofing the MAC address of your laptop keeps you from leaving a recognizable trail on the access point itself, and moving your requests through TOR obscures the trail between the access point and the target.", "Nice try FEDs, Nice Try.", "Consider these set of rules, just an example set.  First, never do anything directly from you home connection.  ", "Always connect through at least two other systems to do your work.  ", "First you hack one system and install a \"relay\" you could think of this as a VPN.  Then you use that system to hack another system and install a second relay.", "The traffic to these relays is encrypted so it doesn't appear to be suspicious.", "Preferably, you want these two systems in countries other than yours and that have poor judicial relations.  If shit is serious, countries without extradition treaties.", "Imagine you need to send delicate evidence to the cops via mail, you don't want the post office to look at what's in the package and you also don't want it being backtracked to you (there are rumors of corrupt cops/delivery guys in the whole city).", "This is what you do:", "You take your evidence and put it on an unbreakable box with an unbreakable lock (strong encryption) and send it to Paul (VPN). Paul's sole job is to forward packages he receives and to destroy all records of who send what to who. Paul sends it to the cops and the cops receive the package with the lock. The cops put a lock of their own with a signature (certificate), so you know it's from them, and mail it back to Paul. Paul sends it back to you and destroys the logs.", "You receive the box with 2 locks, you check the cop's lock is authentic and now you remove your lock, then you ship it back. Now the cops receive the box from Paul (VPN) and remove their lock. Following this method, the cops don't know who send the package and only they have access to the contents of the box.", "The traffic is encrypted. That means the data appears to be a bunch of gibberish to anyone who looks at it without the proper key to decode it. When the ISP looks at it, they can't tell what it is. It's not just hackers who use encryption. Banking and other secure online transactions are encrypted, the military uses encryption, and so do most major businesses. In fact, TOR was created by the US Navy. The hacker's traffic is just a bunch of noise in all of that other encrypted traffic. ", "TL;DR at bottom (I got carried away haha). Also, info may not be accurate because it's meant for you to get the big picture idea instead of technical details. ", "Every action is visible, but not traceable to the final point. Also encryption plays a huge part. Imagine I hand you a box and say \"get it to John Smith\". You know only two points that package's travel - me, and John. Also, even if you opened the box, you would find a locked box because I've encrypted the information.", "Now, let's say you get it to John. John has a key to my locked box. He opens it to find another package which says \"get this to Jane\". So he does. It's also worth pointing out that the new package may also contain a locked box!", "At this point, John knows more than you. He knows the box started at me, went to him, and then Jane. Jane however, only knows it went from John to her. Jane has no clue that I even exist. So when Jane unlocks the last box, she finds (for example) a ring that she bought from me, with an invoice for $1000. She drops the money in, locks the box, and sends to to where it came from (To John). John gets it, locks it in another box, and sends to to where he knows it came from (me). ", "I get the box, unlock it, unlock the next box, and boom, I have $1000 and no ring. Plus, thanks to lock boxes, it was safe the entire time and YOU don't know what was inside it - ever. In the end, only John and myself (and maybe not even me) knew the whole route and final destination. You didn't know Jane existed and Jane had no idea who I was or that I exist. Also, only Jane and I knew what was in the lockbox.", "In this scenario, I am the computer, you are the ISP, John is the proxy, Jane is the server, the package was the information, the lockbox is the encryption, and the key is a shared password. There were two lock boxes and two keys, but that isn't always the case. Also, instead of me putting everything in a ton of lock boxes, I may have put the ring in one small lock box, and that one in another bigger lock box. Then john could have taken my big one off, put my small lock box in his own big lock box and sent that to Jane. Jane would have a key to his big box and my small box. She returns my small box inside of his big box. He switches the small box into my big box and sends it to me. Just to beef up security and keep the keys changing so that it's harder for a thief to have the right keys at the right time.", "With Tor, imagine that instead of finding a ring, Jane found another package and this line kept going. Jane sends it to Tim who opens it to find another package for Blake. Blake does the same to find a package for Jane (this can happen because Jane doesn't realize it's the same package because it's been taken out of two boxes since then) and Jane does the same and sends to Matthew.", "You and I know it started at me and went to John. John knows it started at me, went to him, then went to Jane. Jane knows it came from John to her and went to Tim. Tim knows it came from Jane to him and goes to Blake. Blake knows it came from Tim to him and went to Jane (Blake doesn't know Jane already had it once). Jane knows it came from Blake to her and goes to Matthew (remember, she's clueless that she's already had this package), and Matthew knows he got it from Jane.", "Only I know that it started at me and ended up at Matthew, but I MAY have no idea who Matthew actually is. Most importantly, no one -not even me- knows the entire route. Everyone only knows where to send it, and where to return it when it comes back eventually.", "So now, Matthew packages the information I requested, sends it back to Jane, who knows to put it back in the box she took it out of earlier and send it to Blake, who knows to put it back in the box he took it out of and send it to Tim, who knows to put it back in the box he took it out of and send it to Jane, who knows to put it back in the box she took it out of and send it to John, who knows to put it back in the box he took it out of. And send it to me!", "And you're just sitting there like \"oh this box again... too bad it's locked and I can't see inside of it\". But even having one or many keys wouldn't help you much, because you'd have to have all the keys to open all the boxes to find what information we were sending each other. At that point you ", " also learn every point on the route - something no one knows. You'd be able to shut us down. Even if you did, I'd come back with a different route, different keys, and different ways of doing things. ", "TL;DR", "A connection can run through a line of servers. Each server only knows the server in front and behind itself. Your information passes from your computer, to your ISP, to the first server in line, who passes it to the second, who passes it to the third, who passes it to the fourth, who passes it to the fifth, who interprets your information and sends a response. The line then happens in reverse. No one, not even you or the ISP, knows the entire route the data took. The data is also encrypted, so no one can peak at the data.", "Network Engineer here. Used to work for a major ISP's infrastructure engineering department. Part of my job was accommodating court orders, ie: cooperating with Law Enforcement to help them tap traffic.\nThe main reason you're anonymous is that there's millions of customers connected to your ISP, and while they have the wherewithal to track any one individual's activity, they CAN NOT capture everyone's every packet and destination. There's two types of information which can be gathered at the network layer: Where you're sending data (and receiving it from), and what you're sending. Getting the 'where' data is considerably easier, we need that information to deliver it. What you're sending, however, requires considerably more effort. There's definitely techniques to get a 'copy' of your traffic and send it elsewhere, but that can be very payload-intensive to perform on a large scale, so collecting all of that data for everyone is prohibitively expensive. Then there's the question of encryption. Say I do have all your traffic. I still need to be able to decrypt it, which adds more expense to figuring out what you're doing. It's not impossible, just like cutting the locks off a bike is impossible, but it requires tools and time, and that costs money, and ISPs aren't willing to undertake that effort simply to do the FBI's job for them.", "Visiting a website is like sending a letter. You take what you want to send and put it in an envelope and address it to Mr Google. Now the postman, Mr Comcast can see that you sent something to Mr Google but can't look inside to see what it is.", "Now say you want to contact Mr Silkroad for all your illegal drug buying needs.

So you instead put the envelope inside of ", " envelope and send it to Mr VPN who then opens it and sends ", " envelope off to Mr Silkroad for you.", "Mr Silkroad then responds to Mr VPN who puts the response inside of his own envelope and sends it to you.

It's entirely possible that the attack looks like:", "Attacker ==TOR/VPN==> PWNT SYSTEM ==TOR/VPN==> Target", "There were NSA hacks that got disclosed recently, and there is speculation that the NSA was using a third-party server to stage an attack, and was unable to clear the files off that system after the attack was concluded. ", "While the first connection is typically seen by the ISP, keep in mind that attackers go through several hops before getting to the final destination. So if an attacker hops from Brazil to Russia to China to the UK to Russia to hack a system in the US, the last hop from the defenders perspective will be a Russian IP.", "To find out where an attack is coming from, you look at the IP address where it's coming from. If the first hop back is in Russia, you would have to subpoena records in Russia for that IP address, then subpoena the information from the UK for the Russian IP address, then submit a subpoena in China for the UK IP, and so on and so forth. Many of these countries do not have data retention laws, making it extremely difficult to find out where that comes from. ", "For VPN's, if this is the first hop, the ISP's typically don't have visibility into this. (inb4 NSA) The \"tunnels\" are encrypted, so even if the ISP's were looking, all they could really see is that there is encrypted traffic, but not where it's going. Think of this as water going through a PVC pipe. You know there's something going through, but you don't know if it's blue, red, purple, or even water. ", "While it does seem pretty grim, you have to keep in mind that the attackers are human, too. Everyone likes a pat on the back or wants to brag, so when someone wants to mouth off on a forum, or re-use a personal email account for bad things, it's slip-ups like this that security researchers look for. We're all human, lazy, and want to do the least amount of work to get the job done. Hackers, too. ", "On the human topic, you also have to remember that attackers have different tools, tactics, and procedures (TTP's) that they like to use. A mechanic knows how to work on an engine, can replace spark plugs, and has their favorite set of wrenches that they like to use. Dewalt? Makita? Bosch? Or do you have a custom tool that you like to use? ", "Attackers are a lot of the same way. Some like to use Metasploit, others roll with exploit kits, and some like to create their own tools. Others are known for different infrastructure, and this is where attribution comes in, or the act of (trying to) identify who an attacker is. This is never 100%, and you've probably seen from headlines of \"It's China\", \"It's Russia\", \"It's North Korea\", or some other form of a bear or panda.

The hacker had subverted a server in China, and connected to our server from there.

The connection would have been encrypted, so there's no way they could read the traffic, even if they could be bothered.

", "Now, you seem to think that your ISP can see every action you preform, but that is just not true. This is where that handshake I mentioned before comes into play. Each participant in the tor network has two cryptographic keys, a public key and a private key. If you give someone your public key, they can encrypt data sent to you, and only you, who holds the private key, can decrypt that data. So the only data that your ISP can see is you sending your public key, and your tor entry node sending its public key. Once that handshake has taken place, all of the data you send to the Tor entry node is encrypted with its public key, and unable to be decrypted except by the holder of the private key (the tor entry node). And in fact, each link in the tor chain comes with its own layer of encryption.

If the node is online, it will begin sending instructions to the victim after it checks in. Of course, since the commands are issued to and from binaries, they will encrypted or encoded in any way the attacker sees fit to keep it from being detected by any monitoring systems.

C4 plants have a clever adaptation to one big efficiency-loss. the chemical that binds CO2 in plants, so that it gets from the air into the plant cell, can also bind oxygen. you could increase CO2-concentration(that's done sometimes in greenhouses), so there's more CO2 vs. oxygen. C4 plants do something like that too, they use a different chemical, that only binds CO2, and then transport the CO2 into a kind of airducts in the leaf where the CO2 concentration becomes very high and the original chemical can do it's work with high efficiency.", "however, it's not easy to turn a C3('normal' plant) into a C4, since it's not just that one chemical, but also the airducts in the leaf.

Such geologic formations are unfortunately not widespread and accessible, if they were we would have been doing this in a wide scale. We should learn how to trap carbon in the biomass fast, so that we benefit from the super fast growth of algae.

So with a (normal, unweighted) coin, you lose because the odds are 50-50 but you aren't getting paid in proportion with the odds.

On average the house has an advantage, but if in the past a bunch of cards have come out that make the true odds of future hands more likely to favor the player, then in those rare situations, the player can win.  The trick that card counters use is that they bet really small when they house has the edge (most of the time), and then bet as big as they can when the player has an edge.  That way, by betting bigger, they offset the fact that they only have a slight edge a small amount of the time.

Indexes are just slight modifications to your play strategy. Without indexes, you would play using what's called the basic strategy. Everyone should use this, and the dealer is likely to even help you follow it if you ask questions. The basic strategy gives you the best move in every situation. If you have these cards, you do that. If you have those cards, you do this. This strategy is optimal in the average case if you don't have any extra information about what cards are left in the shoe. But you do have extra information. So, each index modifies what you do in one specific instance based on the cards you have counted. For example, you normally would hit when you have 16 and the dealer is showing a ten, but you should stand instead if you know there are more tens left in the shoe than average (because you are too likely to draw a ten and bust).", "Does this work?

Second, they are prone to shuffling the entire show more often, negating the count that you've established. Counting is a very slight statistical edge and is subject to variance like any other form of gambling. Short term results do not generally match the long term odds, meaning that you need to play a ton of hands perfectly to manifest your advantage. ", "It's worth noting that the MIT students that did this worked in teams to minimize variance and maximize returns. It is way easier to turn a profit with a team of 10. Some players are scouting for hot tables by watching the game in progress on various tables, counting cards from the sideline, and noting \"hot\" tables for their cohorts to play on. This lowers variance and gives an increased edge.", "Lastly, Blackjack isn't the only beatable game. Professional poker players beat No Limit Hold'Em, Omaha, and Stud games all the time. In fact if I recall correctly, Stud Hi/Lo and Limit Omaha 8 are considered by some to be solved games. What makes cash game Poker difficult to be consistently profitable at is the rake the house takes from each hand. If the rake is high enough then it can make the game unbeatable. Tournaments are a different beast in some ways.", "Perfectly playing Blackjack combined with some of the simpler card counting techniques can get someone up to (almost) a 97% payout. That means that over time, for every $1 you bet, on average, you can win $0.97 of it back. Why such good odds? Because each hand is based on the previous hand, and smart mathematicians have sat down and figured out the probabilities so you always know when to hit or stand based on what you have and what the dealer's showing. Of course, that depends on you having memorized the perfect steps (including the steps for what to do with every possible pair option and every possible Ace (count it as 1 or 11?) option). The casino is fine with those odds, because it means: A) most people don't play that well, and B) even if you do play that well, it's hard to keep track of every card that hits the table, and C) even if you do play perfectly and count cards, you're still going to lose money over time unless you also change your betting patterns, which is easy for them to notice and will get you kicked out.

Count cards in the most complicated way possible, because that's the one that gives you the most accurate results. Simple (well, complex) mathematical probabilities show us that a higher percentage of 10s and face cards (worth 10pts) vs lower cards (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5) gives a known advantage to the player, while the opposite gives advantage to the dealer. This is because you can change how you play as the decks progress and the probabilities chance, but the dealer always has to follow the exact same known rules. Your first hurdle here is that there's no guarantee that a positive probabilities situation will happen anytime soon. It could take an hour or two of playing (losing money, on average, with every single hand) before you reach the point of having a relatively low (but not too low) number of cards left to be dealt while at the same time having a high percentage of face cards and a low percentage of low cards.", "Step 2: Suddenly change your bet amount to be really high. Again, this is probabilities, not guarantees. You've now reached a situation where you have a roughly 104-107% payout for the player who plays perfectly, meaning that for every $1 you bet, you should, over a long enough time period, get roughly $1.04-$1.07 back. Problem is, you have to make back all the money you lost waiting for this situation to happen AND the situation has to actually work out AND the probabilities have to remain in your favor for long enough for you to do so. And remember, no guarantees mean the odds could be very much in your favor, but you still lose. It takes many many hours of playing and counting cards in order to be in this situation enough times to have the payouts work out for you to make any money off the casino.", "So why doesn't it actually work? Easy: it's against the rules. If a casino sees you suddenly change your bet from $20 to $2000 near the end of a round of Blackjack, they know you're counting cards. Do that once, you might only get a warning. Do it a second time, and you'll be banned from entering a casino again. And, yes, they share their blacklists with each other. Also, counting that many cards can be quite difficult. You have to continue playing perfectly AND count every face card and low card that appears on the table AND keep track of roughly how far through the decks you are AND keep track of roughly how far you have left before the dealer reaches the yellow card that ends the round and causes a reshuffle AND do math in your head that takes those data points and converts it all into probabilities, all while there are people getting up and sitting down, drinks being served, dealers changing, people talking and jostling you, etc. Is it possible for a very smart person with a good memory and LOTS of practice? Yes, but then we get back to it being against the rules.", "Then how did those MIT guys do it? Simple: one person would sit at each table and follow step 1 for hours on end. When the odds turned in their favor, they would keep their bet the same, and instead make a gesture, like blowing their nose or adjusting their glasses. That would signal someone else who has been watching the whole time (without being too close) to signal someone else who was on the other side of the room, to come over, sit at the table (hopefully there's a seat available!) and bet big on every hand from then on. And even then, they had to rotate who did what, and even then, they still eventually got caught.", "If a casino ends the night with a loss, they are going to record the faces of every person who played well that night. It happens again, they'll compare those faces. Before long, even with disguises, faces get recognized and people get banned.", "Finally, what about playing digital blackjack, on a screen? Well, that's going to give a roughly 93% payout, because it shuffles the decks after EACH hand, and there's no way to count cards. So for every $1 you bet, if you play perfectly, (which almost no one does) you can hope to win back $0.93 of each dollar you bet, over the long run.

You don't get anywhere, you win one candy, then lose one, win two, lose three- you are not making any headway. But then you notice that during the previous hands, a lot of plus cards and neutral cards had come out, and you make the clever deduction that there are a lot of negative cards left in this shoe. You also noticed that the negative cards have hurt the dealer more than help, and this typically yields you another piece of candy. So instead of betting one piece of candy, you bet 5.

Because in casino Blackjack, aces/10s/face cards are really bad for the House and really good for the players. Remember, the House has to hit all the way up through 16. The more 10-value cards left in the deck (ie, 10s and faces), the greater the likelihood that one will show up when the House needed a lower card, and instead of a strong high hand, the House will bust. That means the remaining players win, regardless of how low or weak their cards are. ", "The same is true in reverse: If there are fewer 10-value cards and more low-value cards left in the deck, the House will develop a stronger high-hand more frequently without busting, and players will need to draw more cards and take greater risks to beat it.", "Also, as a side bonus, more 10-value cards in the deck also means more blackjacks for the players, which pay 1.5-to-1. It does mean that the House hits blackjack more frequently too, but players only lose their regular bet, not 1.5 times their bet, so players come out ahead there too.", "This is what happens when people count cards: They're not counting the individual values -- ie, not keeping track of the 7's or the Jacks individually -- but instead, they're keeping track of high cards vs. low cards. When the count suggests that there are more high cards left in the deck, they'll increase their bet, since the chance of winning is greater.

It's at this point that professional Blackjack players are able to cash in, even if it only happens every once in a while. Pro players are in it for the long game, and the point is to make your money over time, rather than hitting it big in one-hand jackpots.

Well, the fact is, to exploit these kind of narrow odds, you have to be really, really good at what you do. Blackjack is such a simple game for the unwashed masses to understand that the casinos make crazy tons of cash from them throwing away their money on bad hands that they can afford to let a couple of sharp counters exploit the odds every now and again.

When you know the cards in the deck are mostly high cards, your odds of blackjack can go up from 1 in 21 to 1 in 19, 1 in 18, or better (since any aces are more likely to be paired with a ten instead of a low card). When the odds of getting blackjack are high, card counters will increase their bets to gain a small edge over the house. When odds of a blackjack are low or normal, they will decrease their bets.

First of all your odds aren't increased greatly, where you normally have about a 49% chance of winning each hand, card counting will only increase this chance to about 53% if the count really favours the player. So even if the count favours you, you still need luck, and that is only if the count becomes favourable in the first place.

This is pre-production and can take up to a few months. Then the shooting begins and shooting typically runs between 30-180 days depending on the film. Now here is one key difference. When shooting a film you may shoot a few scenes a day. Maybe 3-6 if that. It's a lot slower because there is typically the request for perfection in film (hence why the best in the business make films). After your 1-6 months of shooting the video will then go into post-production. Here is where the editing begins, marketing, distribution, etc. Editing can take up to another 6 months some times. This is another key difference between film and TV. In film everything is done in chronological order. First is pre-production then you shoot and only then you edit (Post-production). You also sometimes need to go back and re-shoot scenes.", "To make a TV show (and here I'm going to use GOT which is much more difficult to shoot then something like modern family for example) you still have the same pre-production but each episode is normally treated differently. As if each episode was it's own film. This means that while you're shooting episode 2 they are already editing episode 1. While shooting 3 they edit 2 and so on so forth so you can have things run concurrently at the same time which in film you can't. Shooting schedule for a TV show also runs 6+ months. Typically 10 months. Actors work for 10 months and then have 2 months off. This of course all depends on the show. Also, in TV you shoot a lot quicker. You may do over 6 scenes a day. In the case of GOT there are actually 3 shooting teams. So while team 1 shoots scenes in Ireland, team 2 is shooting scenes in Czech Republic (I believe this is one of their locations) at the same time. This means actors a, b and c are in Ireland for 4 days and then actor a flys to Czech for 2 days of shooting there while actors b and c are shooting scenes in Ireland that don't require actor a.

If you notice the best shows actually have less episodes per season than big network shows because of this attention to detail.

If the movie industry is anything like a standard office with yearly budgets we have to maximize the use of the budget so next year we can ensure a similar or higher budget.

Also, it takes a lot of time to pack in the storytelling required of a 2 hour movie, but a television series can \"waste\" a lot more time on filler dialogue and scenes.

It's also possible that humans would have figured it out from watching animals for hunting and observing their mating cycles (or from domestication of animals, but that came later).", "However, the exact mechanism remained unknown for some time and there were all sorts of misunderstandings about reproduction in the ancient world.

The parts of the brain associated with the somatic marker hypothesis are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. When damage to these areas occur (such as in traumatic brain injury) it has been found that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions on gambling tasks. Why? Because they aren't experiencing the same emotional reaction to betting or losing, meaning they are less likely to \"learn from their mistakes\" because they don't experience or process disappointment or regret in the same way.

The energy from the outside is in the form of (mainly) fat and carbohydrates, and requires oxygen to properly process it. This in turn increases the need for oxygen, and the heart starts to pump faster, and you start to breath faster.

Regular exercise causes your heart to pump more efficiently as your stroke volume (amount of blood pushed per heartbeat) and contractility improve (how hard it is contracting). You also improve in other ways, you develop more capillaries in your skin and muscle. Your muscles become more aerobic in nature by gaining more mitochondria. Your body becomes more efficient at providing oxygen, using oxygen to make ATP, then removing acid and Co2 buildup.

With caffeine the heart rate increase can also be erratic which is more harm than good. To explain this you need to understand how the heart beats. You have atriums and you have ventricles. The heart can move blood because it always contracts the atriums then the ventricles. If the atrium or ventricle contracts twice in a row it is not really moving any blood. This can be very dangerous as it can lead to an arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm.

Which isn't a property of the complex alorithms simulating a human, but of the computer system being fundamentally an abstracted and formalized form of communication designed to be handled by automated routines. And this is the primary reason why programs can succeed at Turing tests, and why the reverse Turing tests in the captchas (..is there a Turing in the acronym here?) fail to weed out bots. An awful lot.", "So even very complicated captchas can be beaten by an algorithm at fairly high rates of success, even if they rely on a certain amount of luck (that because of the formalized level of language is indistinguishable from user-error).

Specially since you can learn from utterly convinced professors at very good schools, that, essentially, increased complexity and obscurity in itself is going to provide security.

No such thing is the case, and an unfortunate amount of computer programming, for example when it comes to internet security, operates on principles like that.

I'm simply pointing out that the simple check can be beaten, just at a marginally higher frequency than the most obnoxiously complicated scripts.

In a basic sense, this is what produced undergraduate degree-level library training. For degree level training, generally you need even more highly trained educators to provide the training - thus, advanced, scholarship-based degrees in librarianship evolved (e.g. Masters and Doctorate) so there could be people to train librarians. Scholars of course must do research, and so the field of Library Science was born. As more research was produced, more librarians felt that research was an essential aspect of all librarian jobs, not just those that were library educators.

The idea was that if you owned property in the place you were voting, you would vote for things that would lead to the success of the place as a whole, so the value of your land would go up, your farm would succeed, etc. If you were just some guy working odd jobs, you were more likely to vote for the guy who offered you free food and money until the whole economy tanked, then up and leave when it went south.", "This isn't as wrongheaded as it may seem at first blush. A decade ago, many South American countries elected very far left politicians who essentially took the position of \"We'll just give the poor people who voted for us free stuff\". Brazil's Lula, for example, was elected largely by uneducated or undereducated poor people, who he then pandered to by constantly giving them things for free. While he was extremely, extremely popular at the time, the end result was that he took Brazil from having overflowing coffers to being buried in debt, contributing massively to Brazil's current economic situation.", "Obviously, I don't mean that to say \"Only rich people should vote\". But allowing everyone to vote does have some trade offs.", "Anyway, to the point of the question, it wasn't until very recently that women were allowed to own land or get a very good education. So, in the context of the views of the time, not allowing women to vote actually made a great deal of sense. If you want to restrict voting to educated people with a vested interest in the long term success of the area (in this context, landholders), then women of the time genuinely rarely met the requirements.", "Ultimately, women not having the right to vote until the 20th century wasn't necessarily always specifically sexist in and of itself, but rather the result of other forms of sexism. The whole thing is fairly convoluted when you get into it.", "Edit: A word", "Edit 2: Just wanted to clarify a couple things. Apologies for the really long edit, but numerous people have responded to me making basically the same couple points, so I figured I'd address them here instead of just saying the same thing over and over individually.", "First, Regarding former Brazilian President Lula, I certainly don't believe he was all bad. The poor in Brazil have it extremely bad, and Lula's predecessor Cardoso probably focused too much on long-term economic growth and big picture, and not enough on helping the people here and now. As can be seen in the American midwest, rustbelt, and inner cities, ignoring people who need help now in favor of making it better for everyone isn't a perfect plan. However, Cardoso did manage to create an economically stable state, which set Lula up a good situation for Lula to implement much-needed reforms. However, he tried to do too much too fast. Brazil's economy was booming, and he dove head first into creating tons of assistance programs, pensions, etc., which helped millions of people.", "Unfortunately, this was all contingent on Brazil's economic boom continuing. When commodity prices started dropping and oil started bottoming out, Brazil's money well dried up, but government spending didn't diminish. The aid and reform programs continued on, but now without any way to fund it. Rousseff probably had time to stop it, but instead she burned everything to the ground. Now most of those people Lula temporarily helped are in as bad or worse situations than they were before. Ultimately, he broke a very simple economic rule for governments: Save during boom years, spend during bust years.", "Again, this isn't to say everything Lula did was bad. Helping the poor is something that Brazil needed for a long time, and still needs a great deal of. My point was, his electorate didn't want a better situation in 5, 10, or 15 years. They wanted a better situation right now, and he gave it to them. Now that's gone, because by giving them what they wanted when they wanted it, he created an unsustainable economic situation.", "Second, regarding the beliefs that I'm promoting restricting voting to rich landowners, I absolutely am not. I didn't address the issues with only landowners voting because that wasn't the point of my post. I was providing context, with a modern example, for the problem those voting restrictions were trying to solve, and the role they had in why women couldn't vote, as was the question asked by OP.", "The fact is, many people, regardless of economic class, gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other differentiation, probably don't make very good voting decisions. My personal opinion, since it's being assumed quite a bit, is that ideally, we WOULD restrict voting to qualified people. However, I've yet to learn about or think of any system of voter restriction that would prevent people who don't have the ability (for whatever reason) to vote responsibly and intelligently while allowing all the people who do. There are vast numbers of issues poor people face, for example, that wealthy and middle class people have absolutely no knowledge of, so obviously poor people DO need to be able to vote.", "As far as I see it, allowing everyone to vote creates fewer problems than restricting voting in a flawed way. Allowing everyone to vote is much like democracy itself: Extremely flawed and riddled with countless problems from beginning to end, but unfortunately the best form of government we've been able to come up with so far.

There's no possible way to thorough discuss the economy of an entire nation in a standard sized book, let alone a couple paragraphs on Reddit. Combine this with the facts that it's impossible to accurately gauge why and how an economic situation came to be until at least several decades later and that I am not, and would never pretend to be, an expert on Brazilian economics (although I've done my share of research into it, and have discussed it with a Brazilian economist whose views and opinions I regard extremely highly), and you're going to get a cursory summary that doesn't take into account nearly all the minor details.

I happen to disagree with them, no disrespect intended.", "Edit 4: I'm never sure if it's appropriate to make an edit when someone gives you gold, but I didn't do it the one other time someone was so generous and I felt like a giant ungrateful dick. Thank you for for the gold, anonymous gilder, sincerely!

So they assume a couple will be voting the same. Now, (re: husbands obligation to carry out physical task) and now you've doubled the possible votes. However, this is highly inconvenient to households of lesser means. poor to middle-class homes where the mother and grandmother simply cannot easily travel out on windy rainy nights days and leave children behind (or take them). ....  however ..... this was NOT as much the practical issue for wealthy upper-classes who had maids and nannies and the ability to take covered coaches and escorts and stay in hotels if need be etc.", "so what they feared was basically the middle-poor folks can still only send the husband to cast the vote on behalf of the couple.

In one book I was reading about a US debate it was almost hilarious how the strictest opponents to women voting were funded by and made of: The local saloon owners, the local whorehouse owners/staff/regulars, the local casino, the local boxing organizers.

", "As for why 1918 and not a little earlier or later, the main reason was WW1. A lot of men were fighting on the front and women filled in for their jobs at home. As a result, women became seen as more capable. Right after the war, Parliament passed a voting law that got rid of a lot of previous requirements for men (only about 60% of males over 21 could vote prior to 1918 and many men returning from the war did not meet the requirements, which was not politically popular) and it gave some women the right to vote (over 30, with some property and education requirements).

The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, George IV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When George IV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, William IV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor.[5] King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.[6]\"", "Queen Isabella of Spain was the most powerful monarch of the World after Columbus discovered America (and a very powerful one before).

If someone brought to the poll seemed incapable of voting.  If a kid comes in, gives their name, and goes to vote after being confirmed as a registered voter, no intervention needed.

I'll never forget talking with one of my favorite professors of medieval history and asking her \"what happened\" in that regard, she said the creation of the middle class led to a more \"relaxed\" lifestyle for women to stay at home, so it just sort of became this weird thing for men to assume \"oh, women stay at home because they're not smart enough\", when really it's all tied to money and labor.", "It wasn't about intelligence so much as political responsibility.

Conservatives in the 1800s and early 1900s were very threatened by ideas such as women voting and blacks becoming landowners not so much because these conservatives were maliciously hateful, as because these conservatives were afraid of losing the integrity of the millennia old sense of propriety codified into the cultures and laws of the countries they loved.    In short, they were afraid of the potential for such changes to change the fundamental fabric that formed their national and cultural identities.    As Lindvaettr explains, even politically powerful women used the traditional sense of propriety to further their own ends.

Also in cursive it's written as uu ", "The \"U\" as we know it as a more modern version of the Roman \"V\" which represented our U and W. In earlier versions of written English before spelling was more standardized, U and V could be used interchangeably, but would most often be reversed from their modern usage. It's not uncommon to see \"Uery Trve uirtve\" instead of \"Very true virtue.\" Essentially, the name \"Double U\" stuck from this time period, but the usage of the letters changed.", "EDIT: My source for this is anecdotal, but I have an English degree and have read A LOT of texts using outdated spellings.", "So the add-on question. Why isn't 'm' called a 'double n' ?", "In French it's pronounced as the equivalent of \"double v\", even if you type double u in google translate it comes out as double v in French.", "So I took a years worth of Latin a while back and there is a letter, \"v\" which in latin is easily confused with the other letter in latin, \"v\".  Whereas the letter \"v\" is familiar to a modern speaker, as in the word \"very\", the letter \"v\" is not so familiar because it is pronounced with more of a \"w\" sound, so in Latin a \"v\", as in \"veni, vidi, vici\" (Caesar's famous quote) is pronounced \"weni, widi, wiki\" (the \"c\" in Latin is hard, but began to change around the time of Cicero to a soft \"c\").", "It can be wery confusing for a learner of Latin, so our course (the Oxford course- not the school, its a curriculum) preferred that in cases where the latin \"v\" was to be pronounced as a \"w\" we should just write a \"u\".  Based on this I like to imagine that the \"w\" is really just an adaptation of the Latin alphabet's letter \"v\" (\"u\") (<---- thats not supposed to look like a face.)", "edit: here's a ", " that might be interesting.", "Well, it was double-u back when the shapes of U and V were switched up, I believe. I was reading an excerpt of Genesis for an English assignment, and both letters were swapped."], "SUBREDDIT": "explainlikeimfive", "SCORE": 26867, "TOTAL": 1997, "TYPE": 1}
