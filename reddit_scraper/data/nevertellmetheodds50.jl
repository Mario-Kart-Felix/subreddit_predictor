I can assure you this, it is in fact the operator.  There is no tracking device.  However, it is a teachable skill, and with time a skill one can perfect.  Most PGA professionals have the same cadence, and besides Tiger and Bubba, most golfballs follow a predictable flight.  Some tricks: if you're doing your own exposure take a sky reading and a green reading so you can roll your iris without thinking.  Check your flag/cup focus (this is critical) and know how to get there when the ball lands.  No error worse than mush when you push! Also know where the flag/cup is relative to where your camera is on the green, so when the ball lands  and the flag isn't in frame,  you know which direction to pan to include it.  As for tracking the ball, the operator can set his/her viewfinder to however allows them to see the ball better.  Some people use a very high amount of \"peaking\" which makes the ball pop.  I don't like or use peaking because i set my viewfinder to look more like the actual shot that my eyes see.  As for this shot by Matt Every, I was there, but this is not my shot.

She pulled back the puck in a akward stance Mrs Hewlett is only about 5'3 (the stick was way too big) and she let it fly, I myself & the crowd didn't even think there was enough steam on the puck to even make it to the target, after it passed the second blue line .. I yelled out .. OH ..OH .. the crowd started going absolutley CRAZY .. the puck then decided to get some wheels, feet, legs whatever you wanna call it & went straight into the hole with speed I might add. Needless to say the arena EXPLODED !! People were slamming the glass people in the lobby were charging out the doors & beating on the glass in the concesion area .. all the Warrior hockey players rushed the ice from the locker room .. I have been on crutches for about a week & had one in my arm, when the puck went in I threw my arms up & screamed so loud with such enthusiasm the crutch slipped from my hand & launched about 40 feet in the air, (thank goodness I didn't hurt anyone LOL) I looked over at Brenda with tears in both of our eyes from pure joy jumping & screaming, I looked over at the truck on the ice with my friends Marney Tarbell, Lisa Ellis, Monica Paige & other women associated with the team who helped throw the frisbees & T shirts into the crowd, The truck was just bouncing..
