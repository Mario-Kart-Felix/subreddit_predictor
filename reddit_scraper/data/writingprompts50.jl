Sure, theoretically speaking, it's quite possible. With enough passion, anyone can leave their mark on the world. In practice though, 'could be's don't really hold up. You're more likely to get back-stabbed by someone you trust before you achieve anything. Or blow up at the least convenient moment, fading out as quickly you made yourself known. ", "It's a tough life for both entertainers and terrorists. Even the life expectancy is more or less the same! In all honesty, the only difference between the two of them is that when you commit suicide in terrorism, you do it for your ideals, not because you hate your life. Sergei felt relieved, and even pride, because he had the opposite problem now. He didn't have to stage ambushes in the desert, or smuggle prostitutes out of Eastern Europe. He certainly didn't have to wear a bomb vest anymore. No, Sergei had the best problem he could have. He finally had a steady job in terrorism, only it was the most banal thing he could imagine. He was a janitor for E.V.I.L., the new organization he'd just been recruited into. ", "His gray overalls were very stylish, with a logo of a blown up Earth engraved on its back. It was the kind of thing an evil henchman would wear, just like he dreamed of as a child. Sergei sighed, moping the metallic floors of the lair's corridor. Who was he kidding? He's a failure. Even when he'd been the best student at the training schools, even when he recruited some of the best suicide bombers ever seen in the middle east, the only job he could get after a botched mission in Turkey was this, a cleaning position. Sergei told himself it was alright, he was still working on his field of choice. He was like Madonna now, who worked as a waitress before hitting it big. Part of him hated Madonna, because she represented the very capitalists ideals he fought against, but another respected her for what she'd accomplished. Plus, \"Like a Virgin\" is a song he enjoyed, even if it was just about a guy with a big dick.", "Sergei lifted the mop and strained it above a yellow bucket. He then wheeled it along the hallway, stopping at a dry spot to continue his work. Sergei shook his head, taking a deep breath. He needed to focus. Self-loathing wouldn't get him anywhere. He needed get noticed by a big boss to launch his career again, just like Madonna. It was this damn underground lair that had him so depressed. Everything was metal. The walls, the floors, the doors. It's a miracle people can remain motivated here. No windows meant that only fluorescent lights illuminated the lair, which, by some godforsaken reason, were too dim and bright at the same time. They even buzzed when turned on for too long! It wasn't all bad, though. Sergei felt grateful for the migraine they gave him, because at least it distracted him from his pathetic life. ", "The janitor finished cleaning around a corner, strained his mop again, and looked down the hallway with a grin. Aside from his many skills pertaining to international terrorism, he was also proud of his cleaning skills. He could make a floor sparkle really damn well. Shouting echoed down the hallway, causing Sergei to furrow his brow. This part of the lair was near the computer servers. No one worked around here, so it was normally quiet during these hours. A gunshot then made him flinch. This wasn't good. Sergei hunched and hid behind the corner, dragging his bucket along. ", "An Asian man wearing a black turtleneck sweater then ran through the wet hallway, slipped on the floor, and slid on it until stopping in front of Sergei. The man groaned. He gripped his left shoulder with a strained face. It was bleeding from gunshot wound. Sergei cursed under his breath and rolled his eyes. A streak of blood trailed along the path he slid on, meaning that Sergei would have to mop this hallway again. A bearded man then ran into the hallway and shouted:", "\"Stop him! That man is a traitor!\"", "Sergei nodded. \"I get credit for his capture, right comrade?\"", "\"Yes,\" said the man, getting closer while lowering his Walther PPK handgun. \"I'll make sure to mention you in the report.\"", "\"No,\" said the bleeding man, \"he's lying! ", " the traitor! I saw him talking into a video comm while hidden in the server room! Now he's trying to kill me!\"", "\"Don't listen to the traitor. He's an Interpol spy. He's known as 'The Cyber-Dragon of the East'. I caught him  filling up a pen drive with every operation we've planned for the next month.\"", "Sergei squinted his eyes, shifting his gaze between the two men. He then said:", "\"I see. I will not listen to him, then. You can go and alert the other guards. I'll dispose of this scum for you. As janitor, it is my duty to clean up these messes.\" ", "The bearded smiled. \"Thank you. You've been a great asset. I'm sure the boss will be pleased with your work.\"", "The bearded man then turned around and started walking away. Sergei sneaked up behind him, locking him in a choke hold with his forearm. The bearded man struck Sergei's ribs with his elbows, struggling break free, but failed. Sergei just endured the pain, laughing loudly the more his victim fought back. The bearded man then ran backwards, smashing Sergei into the nearest wall. ", "He widened his eyes when he realized he dropped his gun. He lunged for it, but Sergei already anticipated his movement. Sergei grabbed his mop, ran towards the bearded man, and broke the wooden handle on his head. He then dragged his dazed opponent to his bucket, submerging his head into the dirty water until he flailed no more. Silence. The bearded man was dead. ", "Sergei sighed in relief and walked towards the gun, picking it up. He then turned around and said:", "\"Sergei misses many things about field work. The smell of gun powder. The traveling. Meeting all kinds of people all over the world. But one thing I don't miss is the traitors.\"", "The Asian man smiled. \"Thank you. You saved my life! Not that I'm not grateful, but how did you know I wasn't lying?\"", "\"Easy.\" Sergei raised the gun and gestured at it. \"He used Walther PPK. Only MI6 use pathetic peashooter. They all think they are James Bond or something. A real terrorist uses weapon with stopping power. We can't afford to leave target alive, like happen to you. Also, it's because I believe comrade's words.\"", "\"Lucky me, then.\"", "\"That is to say,\" Sergei aimed the gun at the Asian man and cocked it, \"I believe other comrade's words, too. Give pen drive, and I let you live.\"", "\"I-I don't know what...\"", "\"Don't test me. I know lie when I see it. Reach into pocket, slowly, and slide it across the floor.\"", "The Asian man reached behind his back. He drew a gun. Sergei shot him before he could do anything with it. Sergei then walked up to his body and found the pen drive. A small part of him dreaded being wrong, but his years of experience told him his hunch was right. He then looked at the two bodies and sighed. He needed to dispose of the bodies and clean the hallway. Again. Now that his mop was broken, he also had to get another mop handle. Sergei smiled. Maybe this was the last time he needed to clean in this lair. Maybe he didn't even need to clean this up. Maybe, just maybe, it was his lucky day. He then walked through the hallways with light feet, whistling to himself \"Like a Virgin\".", "The boss' office was the fanciest room in the lair. Its floor was carpeted with purple rug and its walls were covered with polished oak. The lighting was warm, comfortable, the complete opposite of the rest of the lair. Sergei waited for his boss on one of the chair in from of his desk. Once his boss entered the room, Sergei stood up to meet him. ", "\"No,\" said the Boss,  \"please, remain seated.\"", "Sergei nodded and sat back down. \"I hope I didn't cause much trouble. But Sergei misses the field. I will not lie, killing those men was enjoyable.\"", "\"Yes, yes.\" The boss sat on his leather office chair. \" I think we can all relate to the thrill of killing a traitor.\"", "\"I'm happy I was useful then. Could I stop being janitor now?\"", "The boss raised an eyebrow. \"Are you serious? You expect a promotion after what you just did?\"", "\"Yes! I did good, no?\"", "\"No! No you didn't! Months of planning down the toilet because of an idiot janitor.\"", "Sergei squinted his eyes in confusion. \"I don't understand problem.\"", "\"Of course you don't!\" The boss slammed his fist into his desk. \"That's because you did something above your pay grade and expected to be useful. I don't pay you to stop traitors, I pay you to clean the bathrooms. That man was supposed to get away with the plans! They were decoys I made to throw off Interpol! Now I have to wait a couple of months before those Interpol fucks send another of their men!\"", "\"Send another traitor? How do you know they will? How are you okay with that?!?\"", "\"Because half the staff here are spies! Everyone knows it! Except for them, that is. And apparently you! Hell, my head of Human Resources sends all of our employee files to the CIA! Thankfully, I only give info on other spies. Only the janitorial staff are terrorist! Our real operatives are never here!\"", "\"Oh...\" Sergei lowered his gaze. \"I apologize.\"", "\"You're damned right you apologize! You're lucky I don't fire you! Now go back and clean the mess you made!\"", "\"Yes, boss.\"", "Sergei stood up and walked towards the door. Maybe he would have a better shot in Hollywood. He could be a stunt double or a special effects guy. Sergei shook his head. That wouldn't work. The last time he worked with bombs, the suicide vests didn't go off. This was his career. Terrorism was his thing, and he couldn't just quit now. He opened the door and shut it behind him. Once outside, he whispered to himself:", "\"", "\"", "If you enjoyed this, you can check out more of my stories over at ", "5 years ago, I joined an organization, one that I truly believed in, one that gave an activist like me all the resources to help the cause...\nAnd none of the boundaries.\nOne by one, all mt friends were picked of, dying to keep the cause alive.

Adding dabs of white to lighten the green as he worked his way up the canvas. He motioned me over when he handed me my brush, still wet with paint. I picked up a new canvas but Bob held my hand and said softly, \"It's fine, just finish what you started.\" I shake my head, the mess off colour I had left on it one has dried and now it's a swirling mess of red, orange and brown. I was pretty angry when I had started. \"There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents.\" Something about his words comforted me. Bob continued talk as I notice that the dark shade of green is starting to resemble a meadow in the country at night as Bob uses a deep purple as the Sky while he decorates it with clouds and mountains in the foreground.", "\"You know, when I'm feeling down in the dumps and I have no one to talk to I like to paint little friends. See this cloud here, he's my friend, he's just floating around looking over his little friends\" Bob began to spot the grass with white globs of paint, they start taking the shape of grazing sheep in the cool midnight field. I redirected my focus to my canvas filled with such angry colours in such deep contrast to his peaceful work. \"Remember, no mistakes, just happy accidents.\"", "We painted for hours and Bob kept talking... I said nothing for a long time but he would just smile and reassure me as I worked on my piece. I had pictured a Sunday morning in the country with my father as he would take me up a dusty trail up a hill near our house to over look our small town. So I painted a man standing on a mountain over looking a city at Sunrise. While I worked and Bob talked I would notice small things he would do like add small details to everything on the canvas, like he was slowly telling a story piece by piece.", "I could tell he loved art, he kept encouraging me and telling me small tricks to make all the houses and trees and clouds pop and stand out while I slowly pieced together a new happy story I had made come to life from the ghost of a forgotten memory. I kept painting and working on the small things that I thought needed fixing, a little dab of blue here and a smear of yellow here as I added an ocean and a dazzling aura of sunlight illuminating the world I had created.", "And then finally it was done, a man standing atop a mountain looking over the land he loves. I felt pride, I felt calm, I felt the sunshine through the window and the cold breeze of the door open behind me. And on my bed laid a gorgeous painting of a Shepard sleeping in a field amongst his herd under a beautiful starry night. Next to it was a note that just read.", "\"Forgive yourself and forgive her, your friend - Bob\"", "He had picked up the scattered pictures and placed them on the table but left one of us smiling and holding hands. I walked over to my painting and began outlining a second figure.", "The German was at his wit's end, almost ready to throw away the canvas completely.", "Were it not for the man with the strange hair, it would have been one of hundreds tossed aside.", "\"Now remember what I said Adolph\" the stranger named Bob said with his gentle voice.", "Hitler sighed, \"There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.\" He remembered and replied almost robotically.", "Bob nodded, with his strange hair gently shaking. His brush working a nearby canvas as he hummed a wordless tune.", "Hitler could only stare at this oddity of a man and wonder ", "He wanted to know more about America, the country this man belonged to, but he always shrugged off any specific questions.", "The only thing Bob acknowledged was that previous attempts on Adolph's life were from people of his time and some set in Bob's future. Yet here this stranger stood, painting as if he was in his own studio.", "Despite his attempts to apply for the Academy, Hitler was turned down every moment. His personal life was taking a turn for the worse as well.\nMore and more he was frustrated, angry, unhappy, and needed to vent somewhere. He found that place in the happy settings that he and Bob created.", "Wonderful trees, beautiful skies, a utopia, and one Adolph wished would be so in reality.\nThen one day, Bob was not at the easel. He stared at a nearby window looking at the populace below.\n\"I didn't care much to draw people.\" Bob broke the silence. ", "Adolph was slightly shocked by this admission of professional weakness. Bob never admitted to anything limiting himself or Adolph, always encouraging that anything is possible. Adolph wondered if this was a test, \"Yes they do require some extra skill compared to a happy little tree.\" He tried to smile as he replied.", "Bob turned to look Adolph in the eyes; warm but still distant, as though looking at something millions of miles away.\n\"Capturing the esscence of people is hard to do on paint. What matters is capturing the imagination of people as they look at your pantings ", ".\" The man's gaze returned back to Adolph, taking his shoulder and guiding the young German to another room.", "It was filled with all of Adolph's past pantings, ones he thought he threw away. He gave Bob an incredulous look, \"I threw these away! They are garbage! They are mis--\"", "Bob cut him off, \"They are happy accidents. Merely pantings you haven't finished because you gave up on them. Just like how so many give up on lots of things and others.\"", "Grabbing Adolph rather roughly, he spun the man to face his previous discards. \"You left every one of these? Why?\" Pointing to a random picture, \"Because it was after your rejection letter?\" Then another, \"Because that one girl you like didn't reciprocate?\" Another off in the corner, \"Because you were so caught up in the details you didn't remember the heart of your creation?!\"", "At this point Adolph's anger boiled, \"YES YES and YES! All of them are failures. The Academy wouldn't take suchs sloppy details! ", "\" Tears almost forming in the corners of his eyes.", "Bob released his shoulders, the calm voice returning, \"So who are you painting for? Them or you? Each of these paintings deserve a chance to be finished. That's art, that's what is missing, and that's why I want you to finish them.\"", "So the weeks went, Adolph Hitler consulted Bob Ross on every \"mistake\" he wanted to discard. Bob would offer advice on what could be used to improve upon the paintings. As they worked together, Adolph lost his resentment to society little by little and replaced it with his own pride on the art.", "It was later when Bob announced a public display at a nearby park, featuring Hitler's works. The presentation wasn't to the art critics, the Academy, or anyone of high importance to society. It was to the common man and woman. The beggars, the old, the Jews and the Gentiles alike. Some found his art interesting, some disagreed, others found it boring, but those that stayed grouped around him to ask about his styles. With each presentation, the small groups grew.", "Bob tried to show Adolph Hitler that every man, woman, and child deserves to see art. It wasn't reserved for anyone special. It was there for everyone to touch their hearts. As a result of these presentations he made waves, for good and ill, in the art world. Slowly Adolph was displaying his art in public or even painting on the sides of buildings in secret. All of this to show his audience, his ", ", that they had the power to choose what art was instead of the academies.", "Bob eventually returned to his own time, hoping that the swell of the audience would give Adolph the love he apparently didn't get in his life. As Bob noted subtle changes to the \"present\" he noticed that WW2 sadly still occured, but under different circumstances.", "Researching Hitler's life, he found that the young man was killed in WW1 by a jealous French prostitute. Apparently she was enamored by his successes and grew frantic in her obsession. This young Jewish girl killed him and herself in a misguided attempt to \"be together forever\".", "Bob Ross was taken aback by the news, or rather history, and looked at the masses of people in the library.\nConflicted in his feelings. He prevented WW2 as he knew it, but at the cost of a young man and woman. \nCountless lives changed forever. \n\"I didn't care much to draw people.\" Bob broke the silence to himself, \"People are too chaotic to figure out.\"", "Adolf woke. ", "He wasn\u2019t sure what had awakened him, but he found himself staring at the shadowy ceiling of his tiny flat just the same.  It was quiet \u2013 so quiet that he was sure neither dawn nor dusk were anywhere close at hand \u2013 and yet, still he was awake. More awake, in fact, than he had felt in years. He shivered beneath his blanket despite the warmth, and lit a candle. ", "\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He asked the darkness. It felt right, he thought, to speak like this into the night. He could feel eyes on him, even if he wasn\u2019t sure anyone was really there. If he was wrong, no one would be the wiser. But if he was right\u2026", "Hitler gasped as a hooded figure rose from the darkness at the foot of his bed, growing like a shadow at dusk. He clutched the covers closer to his chest. ", "\u201cWhat are you!?\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cSome specter? Are you some devil, come to steal the breath from my lungs and soul from my flesh? Show yourself!\u201d ", "To his surprise, the figure stopped, holding up a finger as if to ask for a moment while he fumbled with his hood. It seemed to bulge oddly, as if it were caught on something, but eventually he pulled it free. ", "It was simply a man.", "\u201cSorry. Must have\u2026slipped? Never did like these cloaks.\u201d The figure said in halting German. He flashed Adolf a sheepish smile, and despite himself the pajama-clad man felt himself begin to smile as well. There was something about him, about the way he looked just a bit embarrassed beneath his disheveled bush of hair that was endearing. Despite that, however, he wasn\u2019t ready to relax just yet. ", "\u201cWho\u2026who are you? Why have you come here into my bedchambers so rudely, and without invitation?\u201d Adolf asked. ", "Again, the man smiled. \u201cOh\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anyone that special.\u201d He said. \u201cJust a\u2026teacher? Is that the word? I work with paint, and I thought\u2026you might enjoy getting to paint, a bit.\u201d ", "Hitler blinked. \u201cI\u2026well, yes. I consider myself quite the expert, if I do say so. But why have you come? Are you from the school? You are no one I recognize.\u201d He looked the man up and down, and was struck by how odd he looked with his black cloak and his fuzzy head. It reminded him of something, though he couldn\u2019t quite put a finger on what it was.", "\u201cWell, no, not from the school exactly.\u201d The strange man said. \u201cI am\u2026from far away? The others, they have\u2026sealed this time off, yes? So no one else can come. You are rather unpopular, where I come from. Many have sought your life, though we have stopped them all\u2026will have stopped them? You even stopped a few yourself, I think.\u201d ", "\u201cStopped? My life?\u201d Adolf asked, frowning. \u201cI have no recollection of this. Why do they seek to kill me? I have done no wrong to warrant it, at least in memory.\u201d", "\u201cYes, well\u2026it\u2019s all a bit complicated. Harder, too, in German. I cannot explain. Regardless, I was sent here as\u2026an apology. For things that haven\u2019t, and will never happen. For my rudeness, I also apologize. Now was the only time I could come. It was the earliest we could reach before they started coming. Now, I must ask again\u2026would you paint with me?\u201d ", "\u201c", "\u201d Hitler exclaimed. \u201c", "! I knew you looked like something! Yes, Mr. Pinsel, I will paint with you. If only because this is clearly a dream, and I have quite the love of painting.\u201d ", "The man smiled. From somewhere within his cloak \u2013 where, Hitler couldn\u2019t imagine, as it was rather tight\u2013 he withdrew a pair of easels, complete with canvas, paint, and brushes. ", "\u201cVery well!\u201d He said. \u201cLet us paint!\u201d ", "And so they did. ", "The hours fled before their strokes, each of them trying to outdo the other in painting after painting. Hitler was surprised \u2013 though this man was clearly not German, he was still very, very good. Better, indeed, than Hitler himself, though he didn\u2019t want to admit it. But never once did he flaunt his superiority. Indeed, he made fun of his own imperfections, laughing and turning them into a beauty the likes of which Hitler had to admire. \u201cThere are no mistakes.\u201d He explained. \u201cMerely\u2026accidents. Happy accidents.\u201d ", "The man, too, was surprised at Adolf. In the history books, all they ever spoke of was the hatred, the atrocities. The monster. Instead, what he found before him was a man. A man like himself, filled with laughter and art and pain and joy and sorrow. Perhaps that was even more frightening than the beast. ", "But soon, the sky outside the window turned from black to gray, and the candle burned low in its stand. ", "\u201cAlas, Adolf, our time grows short.\u201d The man said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I will need to be leaving soon.\u201d ", "\u201cAh! You speak truth, Mr. Pinsel. I forgot the hour! Though I am still not sure whether you were real or not, our time together was quite enjoyable. I hope that you come to visit again. Perhaps there is a thing or two I could learn.\u201d ", "\u201cYes. I think\u2026I think that would be nice.\u201d The cloaked man said, smiling sadly. \u201cGoodbye, Adolf. Good luck with your painting. I hope it brings you much joy, even when times are bleakest.\u201d He offered a hand.", "\u201cAnd you as well, my friend.\u201d Adolf replied. He grasped his hand, and was shocked to find a needle in his palm. At once, Hitler began to fall, only to be caught and dropped gently into bed by the cloaked stranger. ", "The man shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can call the mistakes you are going to make happy, Adolf, but you deserve the chance to make them. That\u2019s only right.\u201d ", "With a whirl of his cloak, Mr. Pinsel was gone, leaving nothing behind but a single canvas and a few drops of paint on the future tyrant\u2019s bedclothes. ", "Hitler paused, he had never seen an afro before.  There's an obscure law of physics where having a 'fro causes your DNA to stretch during time travel resulting in random face twitches that occur long after you return home and sometimes immediate death can occur by your lungs freezing up and you stop breathing.  Time itself seems to transform again in these agonizing final minutes of desperately wanting air but your lungs won't move.  The condition is known as Twice the Time Travel or what scientists call TTTT (mathematicians and lazy people simply say quad T).  Ever since time travel became mainstream every scientist from every era has made it their quest to make the connection between afros and this tragic disease, the only known side effect of time travel.  Some of the best minds from the future, the ones who cured cancer and created the machines to turn salt water into fresh water have tackled this science mystery but there has been no other solution but to simply get rid of the beautiful 'fro.  Even the best of the time traveling assassins from the various eras of the afro don't like to risk it and thus they always cut their hair. But not Bob.  Bob wasn't afraid of time travel, or possible excruciating death or Hitler.  He had made the journey, he was on the other side, he was in front of Hitler in every ounce of his Bob Ross glory, unchanged.  Bob locked eye contact with Hitler, who was staring.  Bob said nothing.  His left eyebrow started to twitch.  ", "Hitler didn't notice the eyebrow twitch.  He was absorbed in his own head, thinking about his mustache and how it didn't hold a candle in the wind to this stranger's hair.  How could he get his own hair to do the same? Women had always eluded Hitler.  He felt if he could learn how to do his hair like this man's he could have any woman he wanted.  Maybe he could even take over the world.  Bob holds out a fistful of paintbrushes and some paint.  \"I know you don't know me, but I know you\" Bob stated.  \"I've come to help teach you to paint all your dreams on a canvas\".  ", "\"Nevermind that\" Hitler replied, gazing beyond the paint brushes, paint, and above the man's twitching eyebrow.  His eyes fixed on the hair.  \"I want to ask YOU about something\"....", "When, Bob Ross was sent to 1910, his mission was clear - help Hitler become a painter. After 3 months of long painting sessions, Adolf was becoming a really good artist. If it continued like that, Bob would be successful, WW2 would never happen. ", "One day, as Bob woke up in his bed, he saw another time traveller sitting in his room. ", "\u201cHi, Mr. Ross\u201d \u2013 said the time traveller. ", "Bob did not answer. ", "\u201cI have to admit, you have been quite unexpectedly successful. Not only have you thought him how to paint, but also, it seems like you have molded Hitler into a charming fellow. You should be really proud.\u201d ", "Bob planned to say something, but the time traveller rudely went on speaking.", "\u201cYou see, Mr. Ross we have run the simulations and it turns out we were quite, quite wrong. It is essential that WW2 happens.\u201d ", "Bob wanted to ask why, but he was interrupted again. ", "\u201cBob, if Hitler does not wrestle control of the Germany. All the scientists, who have immigrated to USA in 1933, will stay happily where they are. This means that Germans will be first to develop the nuclear bomb and that is when they start the WW2, they will also be first to develop the time travelling machine, so if we don\u2019t fix this now we will never have the chance\u201d.", "Germans ruling the world is bad thought Bob, but what could he do, Hitler was really not that bad of a human being anymore. ", "The time traveller continued \u2013 \u201cAs I have said earlier, you were too successful. At this point you are his only friend. So, Mr. Ross future has one more favor to ask. You need to be killed painfully in front of Adolf Hitler by the group of Jews.\u201d ", "Bob was expecting everything, but this.   ", "First WP and not a native speaker so forgive me for the mistakes.", "As Hitler put down his brush, he saw a flash outside the window, the same flash that he saw every week by the men that came to kill him. Hitler, tired of all these time traveling assassins, was on the verge of deciding to quit painting. If his painting really brought this many people pain, then why would he continue.", "The door flies open, \"Hi, I am Bob Ross and I welcome you to the joy of painting\" as Bob runs into Hitlers home.", "\"Yoouuu are not here to kill me?\" Hitler stuttered.", "\"Why would I do that\" Bob replied \"I am here to show you the peace and love that painting can bring to the world\"", "For the next few month, Bob sat down with Hitler and showed him the joy of painting. Hitler has never seen so much kindness, he started to find the love in life.", "One rainy afternoon a flash came outside Hitlers window, the door flung open and a man dashed into the room yelling \"Death to Hitler\". He pulled out a gun and fired it at Hitler with no hesitation. The room darkened, the man yelling \"I did it, I killed Hitl...\" he was interrupted by a gunshot. A flash of lighting lit up the room, the man dropped to his knees, clenching his chest where he was just shot. He stared across the room to see Hitler, on his knees, holding Bob in one arm and a gun in the other. ", "\"Why would you kill him, why would you take my joy away\" Hitler yelled.", "The assassin, shocked, replied \"No, I was here to end your life before you destroyed the world. You were supposed to be the one that died, I was going to prevent the evil you brought upon this world.\"", "Hitler lays BoB Ross' body on the ground and slowly walks over to the assassin.", "\"Why does everyone want me to be evil?\" Hitler yelled \"If you want me to be evil, so be it\". Hitlers gun fires off, the assassins body hits the floor, the Star of David falling out of his pocket.", "The door of Hitlers house flies open, a Hitler with a long black rain coat walks out, a flash of lightning lights up Hitlers face, eyes cold as ice, as if all his emotion had vanished. The Star of David clenched in his hand so tight that blood was seeping out.", "Thus the day Hitlers Joy died.", "Sometimes I hate my job. Simply hate it. At this point I've killed 36 time travelers, they keep coming, I keep killing. I often wish I could just let them finish their job, but at what cost? This was my reward for being the best. I get to do the worst. Each traveler I've killed has had the same idea. Go back, save millions; by killing the most wretched man in history.", "I would do the same, in fact I did. When I first invented the means to travel in time I had a grand time, I was rich, I had everything anyone could ever want. I had seen the most amazing things, but at some point the guilt of not using my invention for something better got the best of me. I went back in time, I killed Hitler.", "It was easy. I could pick any point in his life, even at the height of his power. Simply pop on by and shoot him in the head, strangle him in his sleep or the method I decided to go with: Help an assassin complete his job.", "It was easy as pie. I simply gave a few tips to a man named Nikolaus von Halem about Hitlers plans the coming week and two days later a man named Beppo R\u00f6mer shot and killed Hitler in the autumn of 1939. I joined a celebration in London that evening and met the woman who would later become my wife.", "I decided to stop time traveling and settled with my wife in London where we raised a son and daughter. Tensions had been rising between the Allies and the Soviet Union during this time, but it looked to me like the inevitable Cold War was starting as before, only this time without the deaths of tens of millions of people following the Second World War.", "Germany was split between the east and west and I was sure that while my actions hadn't radically changed history at least I had prevented mass killings, the atomic bomb had not been used on Japan who had capitulated shortly after fall of Germany once the Allied forced had changed their focus on them.", "Everything was going well until one day I heard the chilling sound of air raid sirens. My wife and I rushed our family to the nearest bomb shelter, but it was too late. I was knocked unconscious and woke up to a sight I had never imagined. Dust and rubble everywhere, fires, everything was dark and gray. My children and wife were dead. A building had fallen on them.", "I instantly knew what had happened. I did this. I changed history and now my family was dead. I used my old invention I had swore to never again touch. I tried hundreds of ways to stop the impending disaster, but no matter what I did I could not save my family, I could not stop nuclear war. Every path, every change led to the same result. A world without Hitler it seemed was a world where no one could live.", "I had tried for years to find a solution when I finally made the decision to save one of the worst people in history and kill 60 million others to save the rest of humanity.", "I went back in time, I intervened with Beppo R\u00f6mers plans so he was arrested. Hitler saved and history restored. I was in my late 40ies now, at least that's what I think. It's hard to tell the passing of time when you live outside it. I couldn't go back to my old life. My wife was in her early 20ies at this point, I was twice her age.", "I made the decision to go back to my own time, back to before my time travel antics during the mid 21st century. A simpler more linear time. What I intended to be my travel back to my old town however turned out to be something else entirely. I was in a dead forest. I was sure I had the right coordinates, but my town simply wasn't here. I traveled back to London to see what was going on, and all I saw was again rubble and ruins. The nuclear war had happened regardless.", "I had done something wrong or changed something else. So I traveled back to 1945 and to my surprise Hitler had not died recently, but in a mysterious assassination plot. Perhaps this was a butterfly effect of my previous actions, something I did made history change in some minor way and an assassination was successful.", "I went back to a day a few hours before his death which now was in 1937. It was in the middle of the night, in his bedroom. I stayed in the corner, silent and invisible and simply watched. Then something familiar happened. A time traveler popped into view. Exactly how my invention worked. He walked over to Hitler when I told him to stop. He turned around and I shot him.", "I returned to 1945 to again read up on Hitlers final end. This time I couldn't even find an article about it. After a ton of research I figured out a German soldier had died in 1916 during the battle of the Somme. Somehow my time travel technology was being used by others to go back in time and kill Hitler.", "This went on and on for years. Someone killed Hitler, I found out where, when and how and went back and saved him. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes it was hard. I once spent a whole year tracking him as a child when all I could find was the year of his death. Once he was slowly poisoned over a period of 3 years which was a really hard nut to crack.", "Eventually though, all plans to kill Hitler was stopped short and the traveler dealt with. History preserved and nuclear holocaust averted.", "Then one day when going back to 1945 to see how the war went I was surprised not only that the war hadn't happened, but that Hitler himself was alive and well. He was a painter! Not just a mediocre painter either, he was world famous. He had his own gallery in London and I visited him.", "He was a charming, welcoming man with a family and several children. His studio had a ton of paintings and his life was dedicated to his family and his work. He had never enlisted for the army, never had any fascist views, but he did tell me about his old mentor he met when he was 21. A man with amazing talent for painting who taught him how to perfect his art and be the best person he could be.", "This was something new to me. Rather than kill Hitler it seemed someone went back in time and set his life on a different path. Perhaps this would change things, perhaps this was the cosmic event that could both stop World War II and save the planet from Nuclear War!", "As it turns out however, that was not the case. A quick trip to the future proved as much.", "I went back to 1910, found Hitler and his mentor. I could not believe my eyes when I saw who it was! Bob Ross the famous painter from that old TV show I used to watch. Afro and all.", "I introduced myself to the two men. There was simply no way I was ever going to kill Bob Ross!", "I told my story about how I had been keeping Hitler alive. And to my surprise, Hitler himself wasn't phased by this at all.", "He told me he had been fighting off time travelers since he was a teenager. They usually bolt when he points a gun at them, but some had suffered worse. He had grown to hate the World for this and wanted revenge, until one day Bob came into his life and changed everything. He had come to realize that the path he was on would lead to ruin and horror and so his life was turned around.", "I finally told him about what would happen if he didn't follow his old destiny, about how the World would burn if he didn't do the horrible deeds he had originally done. I took them both to the future they created and showed them the destruction.", "It was Hitler himself that suggested the solution. Him, Bob and I would work together to bring Hitler to power, create The Third Reich and set it and themselves up for destruction in 1945. I would make sure no more time travelers tried their luck, Bob would make sure history was preserved, the right nations invaded, the key decisions made and Hitler would play his role of the most wretched man in history.", "If you read this I'd love to get some feedback! Thanks, I hope you enjoyed it.", "Knock knock. Adolf cursed softly and thought not again, he was in the middle of drawing a beautiful stick figure walking amongst some roses. The flowers need work he thought, as he put down his crayons. He peeked out a window and saw a man with large curly hair standing politely at his door. Adolf had moved so many times just to get away from these strange people, dressed in outlandish clothes, he was beginning to think there was some kind of conspiracy against him. The first time someone interrupted his paint by numbers marathon. The guy just busted in his apartment brandishing a knife and swinging. Adolf took him out with a nearby brass table lamp and dumped him in a canal. The second and third time happened a day apart. One lady jumped him as he went out for his morning coffee, then a guy with a strange metallic body suit attempted to poke him with an electric handheld device. In both cases Adolf fought back well enough to run away and hide. Since then he has lost count how many people have tried to kill or harm him. ", "This was his fifth move in as many months, Adolf thought he was finally free. But no, some guy and his awful hair found him. Knock knock, he heard again. Adolf peeked out again and noticed the man was holding a painting easel, maybe this was a fellow painter he thought, probably noticed my monthly cartoon in Fascistbook. Adolf debated whether to let him in for about four seconds then realized he could use a friend. So he opened the door. ", "\"Hi can I help you.\"", "\"Hello my friend, actually, I can help you\". \"I saw your cartoon in Fascistbook and gave them a visit, they said I could probably find you here.\" ", "Damn, Adolf thought, I told those Semites not to publish my address. \"Well actually I was just in the middle drawing, but I suppose I could spare but a moment.\"", "\"Great! The name is Bob Ross. Mind if I bring my easel in?\"", "Adolf thought that was a bit presumptuous, what if he had been  painting with the smelly markers. He liked to draw a little mustachio on his upper lip with the licorice smelling ones and flex in the mirror topless. \"Sure why not, not like I have anything to do today.\" Nottt, he thought.", "\"Great then. Just be a chap and grab the other end, it's heavy,\" motioning with the easel. ", "OMG thought Adolf, who does this guy think he is. But he grabbed the easel and walked in with Bob. \"Welcome to the abode Bob, can I get you a drink, schnapps, tea, a bit of arsenic.\" He mumbled the last part.", "\"No thanks a-dawg, I can't stay long.\" \"In fact, I can only stay for a few minutes, I just wanted to,\" Bob lifted up the easel, \"paint a happy sunset.\"", "And with that Bob swung the easel around and smashed Adolf in the head, splattering blood all over his stick figure and roses drawing. \"Ah, just a little bit of gentle red in the background, a quick smear here, and done, calmly observe your beautiful work of art.\"", "Adolf watched \"Bob\" work deftly, as if it was second nature. There was envy and wonder in his eyes, but also suspicion. ", "\"Why do you want to teach me? Why would you do this for me?\"", "\"I don't do it for you\" he replied, \"I do it for the world.\"", "Adolf thought Bob meant that the world deserved his art, that humanity would be missing something without it. Tears welled in his eyes. ", "That's not what Bob meant, though. ", "Bob picked up his three inch brush.  Adolf looked on curiously as he didn't know what it was to be used for.  Bob had painted big white clouds in a sky of deep phthalo blue.  It wasn't the best looking sky, but it was still impressive.  He couldn't imagine what Bob would use a three inch brush for, considering the painting to be done.", "Bob saw the confusion in Adolf's eyes.  He explained, \"I'm just gonna dip the brush in odorless thinner, shake off any excess, and then...\"", "In that moment Bob started smacking the brush back and forth on the leg of his easel.  His hair jiggling as if it was one piece instead of thousands of little curls.  He stopped, looked up at young Adolf, with a smirking mouth and a twinkle in his eye, he chuckled, \"And you just beat the devil out of it.\"", "Adolf felt more confused than before.  He was learning to paint, how ever would odorless paint thinner be used.  Surely it would ruin an otherwise finely painted sky of clouds.  Bob instructed, \"All you do is lightly brush all these little clouds.\"", "As Bob brushed, Adolf could see what was happening.  The cloud, lifeless before, began to come alive with motion.  Wisps of titanium white and phthalo blue began to blend into swirls of wind.  A smile came across the eager student's face.  He began the process himself, feeling a new found exuberance for painting, realizing that within his easel he could travel to any place he could imagine, and create  lands so beautiful that people would long to go there.", "Now, thirty-two years later, Adolf looked on as the chamber filled with gas.  The vapors looked of titanium white and Indian yellow through the small round viewing window in the chamber door.  The screams began.  And a tear rolled down his cheek as he remembered the broken promise to a man who gave him a gift greater than any treasure.  The gift of imagination.", "It happened again.  On the way home I heard the noise.  I turn around and it was a hooded man, no different from the others.  I shot at him with my Browning, but this time I missed all 7 bullets.  He quickly disarmed me and threw the gun to the side.  I thought this was the end, one of them had finally bested me, but I was wrong.  He told me to meet him in the back alley by the homeless shelter tomorrow morning.  I will go inspect what he is up to. if he wanted to kill me, he would have already.  ", "He says his name is Bob.  He was standing by an easel and was holding an assortment of paintbrushes and colors.  I asked him what he wanted from me.  He said that he wanted to teach me to paint.  After a brief argument, he convinced me that I had it in me to become a great artist.  He has a very persuasive voice.  If only one day I could be as eloquent as he.  We started with painting an open field.  I did my best, but I could tell that it was unsatisfactory.  The way the lines flowed more matched that of a choppy ocean than a pasture.  He never got mad though.  In fact, he had me keep going with what I had.  He told me to take the titanium white and paint some clouds.  As I painted, I realized that each cloud was softer, fluffier, more cloud-like then the last.  Once I had finished, he took the painting.  It was passable.  Not good, but better than my past accomplishments.  He asked me to come back at the same time tomorrow.", "Bob told me that if I was to apply to art school in June, I would need to do better than just improving. I would need to be flawless.  Not once in the last month has he ever made a complaint, yelled, or told me to start over.  His patience is incredible.  I asked him what the future is like.  At first, he pretended to not know what I was talking about, but once I told him that I knew he was a time traveler, he came clean.  His name is Bob Ross, he\u2019s from 1994, and he has come to the past to educate people in the dying art of painting.  Apparently, my generation has many sub-par painters who cause a chain reaction, destroying art as we know it.  Bob Ross is the last painter, and he wants to revive the art, even if it means he can never go back to his own time.  ", "My painting skills are improving.  Bob helped me get over my depression by having me paint \u201cHappy Trees.\u201d  He has me paint those a lot.   I wonder why.  He knows exactly everything going on in my life.  Sometimes it still amazes me how perceptive he is until I remember that he\u2019s from the future.  He knows I\u2019m homeless, uneducated, and fed up with the world.  But his soothing voice makes everything seem like it will be ok.  In other news, Bob has developed a nasty cough.  Hopefully he will get better soon.  ", "Last week Bob told me to let the art flow through me, both figuratively and literally.  Well, today I came to our little art studio sporting a paint brush mustache.  I asked Bob what he thought.  He said it was fine, but I could tell it disturbed him.  Perhaps it makes me look like a murderer from his time.  No matter, if it was important, he would tell me.  ", "Bob Ross is dead.  Yesterday I took him to the physicians, but we were behind a Jewish family who all had mumps.  Had the doctors have been quicker, they could have saved him.  I don\u2019t know what to do.  Without his guidance, my paintings have reverted to how they used to look: sloppy and lacking detail.  How did he do it?", "I failed my art exam.  After Bob Ross sacrificed his life so that I could succeed and bring back artistry, I failed.  Now I can only think of one thing to do.  I need to rebuild the world, so that art can flourish again.  I\u2019ll start with Europe, unify them all under one banner, and make it so that artists are cherished and given the tools they need to succeed, no matter their skill level.  As Bob told me every day, anyone can paint.  I will make it so that anyone is able to paint, so that Bob\u2019s vision of a brighter future can be realized.  I, Adolf Hitler, will take over the world, and fill it with art!", "On November 23, 1924, wearing a prisoner's uniform and an enviable afro, a new inmate appeared in a cell of Landsberg Prison.

I will ring in humanity's finest age.\"", "Bob shrugged. \"Wellll, the truth might be a little too grim,\" he grinned, or grimaced. \"I figure we just jump right into the good stuff instead here.\" Sensing a pause, he let his pitch drop from sunny to serious, but he kept his smile. ", "\"Look. Adolf. This is your fullest potential, right here. The future hangs in the balance. Now, I'll hand it to you -- you got gumption... one way or another, the world will remember you as a powerful leader. You're the one who decides where to lead. Will you take the art world into a new golden age, or the lead the whole world into a nasty war over -- pardon my potty talk -- a buncha grade A malarkey?\" Swishing his brush in nice circles, he made happy little clouds appear, just all over.

There was such beauty in it, such beauty.", "Could he truly say he was better than this man? Bob still remembered the hateful and angry person he had once been.

Another living, breathing human being. And yet the stakes were too high.", "In the end, that warrior Bob had once been had never truly died. He had simply stepped aside to let the painter flourish.

It blinded Bob with tears. Even at a moment like this, there was beauty to be found on the canvas.", "It had been a few years now since the stranger with the even stranger hair had come into Adolf's life.

Other things had been lost, most art was worthless now, everyone had seen it, and no one was creating anything new, because there was nothing new to see.  Sports had become boring and predictable, as all teammates on all teams usually had the same name, and thus knew everything about what everyone was doing. Another simplification of life, was that there were no longer job interviews.  Your name dictated what you knew, all you had to do was introduce yourself and you were either in or out.   Parents named their children according to the jobs and status they wished for their child, and thus those children were born with the wealth of knowledge needed to function instinctively in the world.  An example would be that most lawyers are named Lauren or David, while most EMT's and nurses are Keith or Rebecca.

I traveled as much as I could, all I really had was the van my parents had helped me buy, a cranky old cat by the name of Strudel, my growing backseat library, and my sketchbooks.  A job was out of the question, no one would hire an unrecognized name, not even as a gas station attendant.  Living within a community was also out of the question, not just because I lacked income, but because people didn't trust me.

The woman ignored hers and grasped my arms in a vice grip.", "\"Do you have any more pictures.  Please. I have never seen anything like it.\"  Her voice was frantic, and I handed her my sketchbook.  It was new and maybe had four or five pictures in it, but every time she flipped a page her eyes would grow wide and fill with tears.

He carefully turned the pages with the curiosity of a child.", "These two were seriously weirding me out.

And sure, when one drawing had been seen, it had been seen, but that didn't stop me from drawing it a new way or drawing completely new subject matter.   I had something that was all mine, and people wanted in on it. ", "A smile crept onto my face, genuine happiness at my individuality for the first time in my whole life.

Was it worth Mary losing her negotiating power by consenting to have some of the female babies named Michael? Even if Michael had some of the males named Mary?", "In the end, the community gave in to their collective desire to avoid needless loss of bodies, and the next generation saw each Name of note having bodies of both sexes, allowing for reproduction internally. Overcoming this hurdle seemed to give the Name societies the confidence to face those the followed, and they enjoyed a time pf peace and prosperity. This, in turn, enabled a renewed interest in space travel, as no Name wished to spend the rest of its (now seemingly infinite) life sharing a single planet with its siblings.

It was a winter Wednesday, which often meant the worst of my customers would be in the box today. They returned weekly, unable or unwilling to feel their way through the flickering shadows of emotions that guided us in life. The cloying familiarity of the salesman, or the executive, or the mechanic, or the single mother, always left a bitter taste in my mouth. Perhaps, I wondered not for the first time, I wanted something different.  Perhaps I should just stop if I knew what would in there tonight and wait until tomorrow.", "Gulping the liquor in my hand, I reached out for it before I could stop. I knew as well as my customers that when you stood on the edge of a void, it was hard to throw yourself in. ", "I grasped the box and gasped as the room dimmed around me. Underneath the current of regulars, I felt something else. Something wonderful. With ease, I sifted through the layers until I reached out - just a sliver, a moment of a moment. I closed my eyes and I pictured the single mother who had grabbed the box. I saw her heave a sigh of relief and felt all the guilt, the fear, and the horror about her life as my own. A life she didn't want.  A child she didn't want. A future she could not face. ", "She bowed her head, and rested it against the table just for a second. In that moment, her son reached up and touched the box before she could slap his hands away.", "It was nothing I had ever felt before. It had been far too short to take it all, and I don't even know if I could have felt it all. It was flashes of moments and feelings that I had never known. ", "I felt.. happy. I was awed by the ocean of turquoise carpet that stretched across the room. I was excited that Nicole, the sitter, was sick so I could drive around with my mom. I was curious about the special box. I was happy. I was happy that I got to spend time with my mom. I was happy that I got to see a new strip mall. I was happy that my boots had kept my feet warm while I stomped through the slush outside. ", "I dove deeper into the stream. The shock of it left me shaking as I swum deeper and deeper into the small donation that had been given. I felt that threaded through it all was happiness about being alive and living a life. ", "Finally, it fluttered away from my scrutiny and disappeared, evaporating into whatever empty space that had left me so broken. My hands fell away from the box, and I rubbed my bleary red-tinged eyes. My muscles were sore and I was exhausted. I sat back in the chair and stared at the box. I could almost remember what it felt like. I could almost remember the pure exuberance, the innocence, of his tiny life. Did my heart beat slightly faster? Did my fingers shake? ", "I stared at the box once again as the morning sun slipped into the sky. I knew there were other deposits in there still.  I knew I could place my hands on it once again, or put it back and wait for new ones tonight. ", "I almost did it. I almost reached out. But I couldn't, I couldn't bare to feel the maelstrom that sat within it. Instead, I closed the blinds and plunged the room into darkness.  I sat heavily in my chair and stared numbly at nothing.

It runs them through like a bullet to bone. Scattered and ripped, torn asunder like the man's soul, once so complete and bright, now floating inside a tornado of red. It surges into me, and I just want to die. I want to join them. I want to hold a daughter I never knew, her face, her laugh. Her everything. I want the love of my life back.", "God, I want it all back. ", "A rustle from behind me emerges into existence, bringing me back to my surroundings. I open my eyes.

It descends onto the projector and becomes lit up on the screen, the words dancing to life in front of me.", "'I lost everything in my job.'

I rub my face and shake my head, knocking the note off the projector. ", "\"Too intense,\" I whisper to myself. I sniff and wipe away the spit from my mouth. Pain is pulsating in my lower jaw; it having been clenched shut these last few minutes. ", "Another note falls through the hole. I prepare to read when I feel it. All through me.

Not to mention the complete and utter disappearance of Trey from Brianna's life. No note, cancelled phone number. And a baby left to take care of all alone. Brianna had dropped a couple of emotes in this week to bear with the pain and seeing her face through the monitor, I couldn't bear to reject the second despite the \"once a week\" rule I'd held so steadfast.", "I couldn't see the full picture until I downloaded the emotion onto my mind-chip but it seemed to be left by some teenager. Teenage emotions tended to be the most difficult, as the pain was coupled with a lack of perspective that made it all the heavier to carry.", "Somehow, I was still hopeful each time a new ticket was dropped in the box. Sort of like how Cleveland Browns fans still maintain at the start of each new game and season only to experience the same results again and again. Einstein had said something about expecting the same results without changing the method, but I was always an optimist at heart. Each new ticket brought the hope of some positivity, but alas, that never seemed to be the ticketed emotion.", "Of course, these are no longer physical USB tickets. The project had since evolved along with technology. What was once a psychological experiment to help clients alleviate emotions by experiencing it with them through a then-advanced dream reader appropriately named ASE (or Artificially Shared Experiences). The machine was a costly investment in the late 2070s but proved worth it as the few offices which offered it became experts in the field of Shared Experience Psychotherapy. Patients, as we called them then, would simply attach their mindchip's USB ticket. I'd do the same, and they'd meditate on the experience for an hour. Sharing this experience fully with others proved to be calming, as they could observe our reactions and we could discuss the pain together. A form of group therapy that we could never achieve without the mights of modern technology.", "But as we continued with the practice, more offices adopted the practice, and our once unique machine became standard. To stay prosperous, innovate we must. I called a friend of mine who specialized in mind augmentation, asking him a simple question which I'd grow to regret; ", "Surely, we foolishly assumed, the pain of one's experience could never be as painful for another. This way, we could minimize the full utility of pain experienced,  as the pain should numb as more emotions are accumulated. We were right and wrong- the amount of pain is lessened, but still rather monumental when compounded by the pain of so many others. ", "And here I am today. ", ". I turn to the machine again, my naive hopes intact. For the first time in many years, I rush to attach my mindchip. This one seems different.", "I close my eyes and smile. A new baby was born that morning to a first-time grandfather.", "I was born in a broken home to a broken mother. As a result, I never really developed emotions. This didn't upset me nor send me into a spiral of self-loathing and pity- it simply couldn't. I had accepted that my life would be emotionless and even thought it would be for the best, life can be full of tragedies and heartache; none of which I would experience. I was at peace with this concept until it was suggested to me that I open a public donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I failed to see any real issue with it and decided to try it, if only for a while.", "That was three years ago.", "Every day since, I have awoken with the same feeling of dread deep at the pit of my stomach. I don't know how I failed to realise that unwanted feelings would be the only feelings donated and that they would be unwanted for a reason. Each day is different. Sometimes, I feel the utter heartbreak of a new mother whose child isn't in her arms. Other times, I feel the intense rage of a man who has discovered his partner is cheating. More often than not, I feel the most paralysing of the emotions-\nloneliness.\nMy days are largely filled with loneliness. A once suicidal person now works towards building a new life as they have gotten rid of the debilitating loneliness that once plagued them so, unfortunately, I now have that burden to bear. I considered ending my own life when I discovered I couldn't close the donation box, but why bother? My (albeit unwilling) adoption of the unwanted feelings of others has saved more lives than I can count and that fact brings me some shred of relief.", "Today, however, was different.", "Today, I woke up feeling energised. I felt tall and awake and fantastic. I felt alive. Someone had donated their happiness to me. I took on the day with the most amazing sense of wonder. Every colour was brighter, each smell was sharper, the breeze was cooler and the day warmer. The world, if only in my opinion, was perfect. I took full advantage of my new happiness. I went on a tour bus that taught me more about my area. I bought lunch in a lovely little caf\u00e9 by the beach and ate it beside the sea. The salty air and sea breeze caressed my cheeks and filled my nose with the smell of opportunity and escapism. I was truly content in that moment.", "I lay down to sleep that night bewildered as to why someone would do this, then it hit me.

At first, I fantasized. I pictured a wonderfully kind 'Good Samaritan' who decided to give someone else a day in the wonderland they knew. Then, I began to rationalise. I pictured a desolate, lonely being who felt as if the entire world was on their shoulders. I pictured someone whose spirits could not be lifted by a day at the beach, or a bus tour, or even the sun shining upon them and the feeling of complete and utter freedom.

Day.", "My bed is built for two, and once held two bodies together. Though I could not love she would tell me what love was. She would tell me that what I did counted as love.

They have medications they claim make it better. ", "Instead I have my box. ", "I'm on my feet now, scrubbing my face in the mirror. Bloodshot eyes from crying so much yesterday, someone must have lost someone and was unable to cope with the feeling. So they gave them to me.

If I could care, I would care that people did not understand. But no one has given me care yet. ", "I could end the loop but...\nI've obligated myself not to. What a waste of such a gift. At least that's what she told me before she left. ", "I open the front door and sigh, looking to the right. A small, black letter box hangs on the bricks. A slot in the top for the people that need it. I reach to open the lid and recoil in surprise. ", "Why is my box hot?", "I reach again, it's not too hot, and pull out a single letter. The envelope is cream with a black seal. I never have only one letter. Ripping open the top, my fingers lift the paper out and I cough at the sound.", "Wait.", "Wait.", "That's not a cough. That was a laugh. I've heard them so many times. She used to laugh.", "My heart is racing as I open the paper. One golden word. ", "Happiness.", "I laugh again. I jump down from the porch onto the smooth green grass. Oh the day, it was beautiful. \nWhy am I crying? I shouldn't be crying. I am so happy. I look up and down the street, my chapped lips cracking at the sides from the smile so large on my face. A small girl is standing two houses down, seemingly alone. She's upset. I can see the tears. Why do I think they are meant for me?", "I slowly walk towards her, past my gate and down the side walk. She's so pretty, even sad. I kneel in front of her and start crying again. I see a figure walk up behind the girl but ignore them, they don't matter now. I hold the paper out to her little fingers and smile, such a good feeling.", "\"We can share it.\"", "She sniffles once and looks up at me, putting her hand on the paper too. A small smile emerges and my heart leaps. Is this love? It must be. The little girl wraps her arms around me neck in a hug.", "\"Ok Daddy.\"", "Is it even worth it? I know that there isn't even a right answer but I still want to know. Nobody really knows me nor do they want to, to them I'm just someone they can use to make themselves feel better. I don't want to live my life like some machine, that's why I made this god forsaken box. I people come by, generally gloomy, and donate their bad emotions to me. When they leave, they go with a smile on their face. Is that what happens when you lose your sadness? Or could it be something else? ", "One morning, when I went to resupply on emotions. I saw a man there and in his hand was a beautiful gem. It pulsated in a soft, yellow color with a tint of orange. I had never seen something so beautiful. The man opened the box and closed it immediately. after seeing the dark purple gloom of what was remaining from last week, he wanted to protect this shining gem from any corruption. He tied his treasure in a small cloth but before he put it in I asked him, \"W-What is that\"", "\"It's my happiness\"", "\"Happiness...\" I didn't think it was real, some people told me that they were able to be happy because of me but I couldn't understand it. I had thought it was some sort of urban myth or a saying of some sort. \"Why?\"", "\"Huh?\"", "\"Why are you giving it away?\"", "\"I don't deserve such a thing in life anymore\"", "\"I see, can you tell me what happened?\"", "It was visable that the man didn't expect me to ask him about his story, never the less, he told me: \"All I've done throughout my life was hurt others for my own self gain.

DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET THAT OUT\"", "I'm going to have to use some anger for this, I always have some in my back pocket just in case.", "\"NOT AS HARD AS CREATING SOMETHING LIKE THIS!\" The man has a shocked expression, I may have overdid it but I'm not going to give up on this. \"It is even harder to nurture this. This isn't your happiness from hurting others this is your happiness from being selfless. But that isn't all I see. I see sadness I see regret, not only in here but in you.\"", "\"I-I-i...\" He's breaking down.", "\"You can't just do this to yourself you've got to nurture this forever, you can't decide to give up on this precious gift of yours.\"", "\"I... t-thank you... so much\"", "I watch him leave, on the verge of crying but he stays strong.

I see a couple stroll up to it and kiss as the man reaches to put something inside.", "Guilt.", "I look down at my malnourished form and cry. I've been tortured with the worst of humanity's feelings and it's my own fault for letting them all in. My boss has probably already fired me, I haven't been to work in so long. I just can't work up the nerve to check. I'm hungry, so I sweep my legs off the side of the bed to get up.

I flop back onto my tear soaked mattress. ", "Helplessness.", "There's nothing I can even do about it. Days have already turned to weeks and months, and I'm on the last pack from the most recent crate of ramen.

The sun is bright. I'm on my way to the box and maybe it will help me understand how all of this is. I've almost got it down to how cold it has to be to be unpleasant. Maybe the brightness thing next.", "I turn the corner and there it is, waiting for me. It looks just like a mailbox, at the end of my street, but everyone in town knows what it is. I pull open the little door and rummage around inside. A warmth spreads up my arm and I know it's begun. I feel it run down the length of my veins until it hits my head and the world turns grey for a moment.", "When I come back, I know that the wind today is particularly unpleasant. I concentrate and come to the conclusion that the sun is lovely, but it's just such a shame it's not warm enough. I poke around in my head a bit more and I find what it is I'm looking for; it shines in my mind like a second sun. And when I turn to it, I can feel all of the dismay and the pain. Someone's pet... I start crying where I stand it is so unbearable, my body shaking with heaving sobs and my hand still in my box.", "Then... Something strange. My hand begins to tingle, then it gets hot. Hot, hotter, hotter, hotter, until it feels like it's on fire. I scream and pull it out of the box but it's already spreading up my arm and I cannot stop it. My every nerve is on fire as it makes its way up and I can do nothing but wait. When it reaches my neck, it sears. It's new, this one. The new ones always do this but I thought I'd felt everything there was to feel.", "It finally hits my head and the fire vanishes. In its place, there is a warmth. I scramble through the feelings and find that nucleus. This one shines so brightly it's blinding. I face it and it blossoms. I see... Me. I see the box. And I see myself reaching into it and my face changing. Again, and again, and again me and the box, my face contorting every day. And I feel pain watching myself... Sadness? It feels like sadness but I don't understand why.", "Then the memories start to glow, like they've been dipped in gold. And my face, my real face, twists. I don't know what this is. My eyes crinkle and my mouth does a funny thing. It's so warm inside me. I... I want to feel this every day. I don't know what this is but I want it. The emotion fades and I open my eyes.", "There is a girl there. Her hair is long and it glows like the memories. Her eyes look like the ocean. She smiles and her eyes crinkle and her mouth does a funny thing. Was I smiling? The memory of her feelings comes back. I don't know how but it feels like a candle in my chest. My eyes crinkle and my mouth does a funny thing but my eyes... I'm crying.", "There is a fire in my chest and it feels like it's been dipped in gold. And I know the wind is unpleasant and the sun is bright but not warm enough but for the first time in my life, they don't feel the way I've been told. The wind is soft on my skin and I love the way the sun makes her look.", "It was a day much like any other. My eyes opened and slowly began to focus on the naked lightbulb hanging above my bed. I had never considered it before; how reflective it was of my life. The bare minimum. Cold, harsh, and rarely paid any notice of. ", "This should have been the first thing I picked up on being out of the ordinary. But I didn't, of course. ", "As I went about my usual routine, brushing my teeth, getting dressed and preparing to walk to work, things felt different. I was brushing my teeth to the rhythm of a song from my childhood, I picked out clothes with a purpose, and there was a definite 'pep' in my step. As I stepped outside, I was suddenly overwhelmed. The sun streaming through the leaves in the tree in my yard conjured images of growing up in the countryside. The smell of freshly mowed lawns tickled my nostrils and brought a.. a smile? A genuine smile! For the first time in my life, I was smiling because my body wanted to, not because I knew it would be out of place not to.", "This was strange, usually people held on to this feeling. I only ever got to feel the unwanted emotions of those around me. Who would ever want to part with this? As I walked down my road, the thought took over my mind. How could you ever be without this feeling? My mind was made up. I couldn't, in good conscience, go about my day knowing someone now felt how I had felt all my life. I needed to find whoever it was that gave away this delight.", "But, how? The donation box was, in essence, entirely anonymous. Unless I saw someone donate their emotions, I would just feel the tug on my mind, pulling me towards some new, dark place. But, I had to find this person. ", "I turned about, and ran back to my front door. Nothing was out of place. The box was there, with the usual slips of tear stained, torn paper, scrawls of \"fear\", \"grief\" and \"sadness\" barely legible anymore. As I rooted through the notes, my mind was already looking for the one pristine, clean cut note which would contain the handwriting of my kind benefactor. It wasn't there. I emptied the entire box, and started to read through each note with care.", "Finally, I found what I had been looking for. However, what I found shook me to my core. The note I had in front of me did not allude to happiness in the least, and had it not been for the smudged, shaky script, I would never have believed this to be what I sought. ", "It looked just like any other; torn, smudged and soaked in tears. My mind was racing with possibilities. As I brought the note inside for further examination, I noticed the newspaper by my door. Picking it up, I read the headline and my blood turned to ice:", "\"Man (19) found in the early hours. Initial reports suggest no foul play, and the circumstances of the death, although not corroborated, suggest this is the first suicide we have seen since 2019\".", "Dropping the paper, I already knew. This was, indeed, a suicide. And I had just found where the donation came from. ", "It started like any normal day. I was emptying all the emotions from my donation box. It seemed like the usual lot people wanted to get rid of. I grabbed the handful, threw the box on the table and let the emotions sink in. ", "I decided to not eat breakfast. Why bother with it? I'd just be hungry again later on. I have no extra money to spend anyway and the price of milk is too damn high. Also with the amount of chemicals in our milk, I\u2019d likely get cancer. You can\u2019t trust water either. Mind controlling chemicals in it. You can\u2019t trust anything from big corporations these days. Or people. Especially people. With their lying and germs. Best to stay inside where they can\u2019t get me.", "With those thought swirling through my mind, I was constantly looking for my shoulder on the way to my room to get dressed. When I got to my room, a new emotion took hold. I looked at the floor at the discarded clothes, as I had forgotten to do laundry the night before. My body started getting warm and I started breathing deeply. I clenched my fists and slammed my right one on the door with a loud bang. I spotted a pair of scissors on the desk and rushed over to grab them. In short work I slashed my clothes to pieces, seeing red the whole time. ", "When I finally came down, I was sitting in a pile of rags. Tears welled up in my eyes. What had I done? Why did nothing go my way? What had I done to deserve this? All these questions rushed through my head as tears started to well in my eyes. I let these feelings roll through me as sobs racked my frame. I curled up into the fetal position in my hastily made nest and let the torrent continue. ", "I don\u2019t know when I passed out but I awoke and was ravenous, so I made my way back to the kitchen to make something. Along the way I passed a mirror and caught a glimpse of myself in it. I stopped in my tracks. When did I become such a fat pig? I prodded and pulled at my body. No one will love me because I\u2019m so fat. Even though my stomach was screaming at me to continue on my journey to the kitchen I was riveted to the floor. I can\u2019t even see my rib-cage or hips. I\u2019m such a fat slob. I continued to stare at myself in the mirror with an ugly look on my face as I studied every flaw on my body.", "Eventually that feeling of no feelings returned. A sort of silence, which is hard to describe to others. The emotions had run their course. All in all a pretty normal day so far. ", "I was still hungry so I continued to the kitchen and made lunch. As I sat down at the kitchen table munching on my sandwich and sipping on my glass of milk, I heard a tinkle come out of the donation box resting on the table.", "I grabbed it and opened the lid, lunch now forgotten, and there was an emotion I had never seen before. It was small and had a golden glimmer to it. Weird. In the 5 years since I put up the box I\u2019d never seen this emotion donated before. Without really thinking about it I grab it and let it sink in. This was the biggest mistake of my life.", "I felt light. Lighter. Like gravity had lessened its ever stronger pull on me. My back straightened and my shoulders un-bowed and for the first time in my life, I took a breath. It was deep, heady and glorious! My eyes closed as this emotion swam through my blood turning it to ether. My heart suddenly felt full. A good full, like to bursting, but with warmth. My mouth did something I\u2019d seen other do. It started to curl upward at the corners eventually showing my teeth. All of a sudden I exhaled through my mouth with little sounds. This was amazing! I opened my eyes and the colours of everything. They popped. The lettuce on my half-eaten sandwich looked so green and the sunlight looked like spun gold. My skin felt charged and my head felt\u2026 free. ", "I basked in it. Let it wash over me. Drank deep from the cup. Tears welled up and started running down my face but these were different than normal. Everything was better. Everything.", "Slowly though, it all started to fade. Going back to that no feelings silence as I sat at the table looking at my half-eaten sandwich. An unknown itch that I had had for my whole life was just scratched. Now that I\u2019m aware of it, it seems like I\u2019ll need to scratch it as often as possible. This was bad. I knew it in my gut. I would do anything to get that emotion again. Anything.", "The sound of pouring rain filled the room briefly before the door slammed shut, reducing it to a muted roar in the thick, stagnant air of that dingy apartment. A single shaft of flickering fluorescent light probed meekly through the window and was quickly swallowed by the gloom. I threw my heavy coat over the back of the chair and a plume of dust rose slowly in its wake. Blood dripped slowly from my hands. It wasn\u2019t mine.", "My sleepless nights were filled with hatred and bloodlust, a burning malevolence far beyond my control. My tortured days knew only the suffocating depression I dreaded so deeply and a profound self-loathing. I sat down on a musty, grey couch and buried my head in my hands. My body shuddered as I silently wept; watery, red tears dripping softly on the moth-eaten carpet. I\u2019m not sure how long I wept in those dark and indifferent shadows, I had run out of tears long before I lifted my head and sighed. I wiped my face and pulled myself back together somewhat, leaving a vivid smear of crimson across my face in the process. ", "Looking around the room I noticed a faint golden light peeking softly out from under the lid of a heavy wooden box on the table. Reluctantly I got up and made my way toward that damned wooden box that I hated so deeply yet relied on so heavily. As I slowly lifted the wooden lid a brilliant light spilled out and filled the room. It was a warm, rich, golden light; nurturing like honey and comforting like the innumerable yellows of autumn. ", "I had opened this box countless times before only to find deathly green jealousy and fears like pitch-black smoke, or a deep red anger that burned to the touch. But now as I reached delicately into the box I lifted out a brilliant little golden light that danced upon my hand, radiating colour into the lifeless greys of the apartment. This was happiness.", "I barely noticed the flashing lights that appeared had appeared in the window, barely heard the heavy thuds that rocked the door and splintered its frame. Filled with an indescribable bliss I fell to my knees, tears of joy welling up in my glistening eyes as the cold metal clasped my wrists behind my back. Weightless, I floated to my feet and glided toward the figures clad in black vests and helmets standing silhouetted in the open doorway. Oblivious to the men who steered me toward the patrol car as easily as a dandelion is steered by the breeze, I felt every rain drop like a tiny kiss on my skin and I drank in its sweet smell. ", "For the first time in my life I was happy.", "I open my eyes and sigh. Another day with nothing but the negative thoughts in my head. Depression. \nI turn over in bed and attempt to go back to sleep. Why do I even want to be here? Send me back to the ever encompassing darkness of sleep where I can dream about never setting up that stupid box. \nSuddenly I bolt out of bed! I'm wide awake with a smile on my face and a laugh on my lips. What is this feeling? I hug myself in joy as I realize I'm happy. \nI quickly throw on some clothes and rush out the door of my apartment. \nOnce outside, I look left and right for the person so willing to give me happiness. \nI catch a glimpse of long blonde hair disappearing into a nearby building. My eyes widen and I chase after her. I barely note the sign on the door, something about services, as I move through the swiveling door and shout, \"Wait!\"\nShe turns around. All the people in the lobby turn. She looks surprised and maybe a little frightened. \n\"Are you the one who donated happiness?\" I questioned.\nShe starts stuttering out an explanation for something I can't make out while clutching the strap of her satchel bag. I stride forward and embrace her with the largest smile I've ever had. \n\"Thank you so much! This is the first time I've ever experienced happiness. Please let me treat you out! I want to repay you for your kindness.\"\nThe woman flustered and stutters again.\n\"I uh It's alright! Y-you don't need to do that. I'm s-sorry no one as ever d-done that for you b-before.\" She collects herself.\n\"My name is Annabelle. What's yours?\"\nI laugh, \"Nice to meet you! I'm Marcus!\"\nFrom that day onwards, the two would become friends, date and get married. She would continue to donate happiness to him and later, her friends and family would as well.

A fog of oblivion. What a waste.", "At the end of the alley was a wooden box, lacquered and pristine. I wiped it anyways and made sure that the light mounted on top was in good working order.

There were so many that I couldn't even see the bottom! One by one, I took each marble and crushed it, letting its contents surge into my skin. Like getting a shot of Adrenalin, my pulse raced, and the cold sweat trickle down my shaved head. My heart felt like it would rip in two, but I kept going. Existence was one long sentence that kept going on and on and on, punctuated by these brief infusions of terrible emotion. Time became meaningless as I savored the collection of exquisite pain.", "All too soon, my nails scratched the bottom. As much as it hurt, I wanted-- no, needed more. Desperately, I looked closer, and my eyes lit up. Wedged in a corner was a bright yellow half sphere. Fear from one of the others still lingered and I hesitated. What would this malformed trace of emotion contain? Remotely, I registered that maybe this would be the one to break me. Yet, I could feel the warmth where my fingers made contact, an trace of rightness in a world of jagged shards.", "I swallowed down the lump in my throat and squeezed. The world brightened. The warmth spread. For the first time, I could see beyond the horizon of that unseen fog. My cheeks hurt, muscles long unused straining from a smile. Then I gazed down to my closed fist, and carefully uncurled my fingers.

How could he devote his life to me when all I feel is emptiness? But today. Today was different. ", "I looked Rick in the eye. His eyes were so beautiful, big and brown and always curious. I traced each freckle down to his mouth. He had a confused smile on his face. His teeth were so white, so straight. I remember pictures of him when he had braces. Rick started laughing and it was only then that I realized I had a smile on my face, I was laughing too. ", "How did I feel today? I felt happy. I felt love. I finally saw the world as it should be.

For the first time in my existence I felt something pleasant, save the faint sense of guilt accompanying each new emotion. It reminded me of the millions of cheaters who gave me their regrets, an awareness of tainted, undeserved delights.", "The number and power of these new emotions grew as did their undertones of regret, but guilt and shame were my oldest friends and an easy compromise for delight.

He looked back at the gargoyle. It was silent, just like his corner of his city, with only a few distant pops puncturing the silence. ", "The masses who came over to churn the billions of dollars that kept the country had fled the neighborhood as they always did at night, especially on a holiday. ", "He tightened his grip on the gargoyle, and looked down at the pavement hundreds of feet below. Today, he would be free. And then stopped. The whispering wind became a violent hurricane, his knuckles gripping the gargoyle head in a death vice became white and all breath left him.  Fear. His feet had turned to lead and would not let him take that one extra step. All he could think of now was his own screaming. He had become a stricken animal void of all control.", "David stepped back into his apartment and collapsed into his chair. The air filled his lungs again as he became his normal analytical self. Independence would not be his tonight. Fear had saved his life tonight, as it had done every day, every day, every day for a long time now.", "He followed the gaze of the stone gargoyle to the barges enveloped in smoke. On the banks of the river, stood the thousands of people of the city and beyond. They filled with joy and happiness at the fireworks exploding above them. David could almost feel their happiness. Almost, but never quite. David now had a new quest. To give himself the gift of happiness. ", "How I crave the sweet release of opening my box, seeing what emotion it holds.  Each day a different twist of anguished pain, a jolt of remorse or raging guilt awaits me. A feeling like no other I have. A knot in the stomach and a quickening heart beat. The drug that fuels my reality, taking my life beyond a metronomic monotony of pure existence. Each tear of sadness a reminder that I am living. Other people's sadness is my everything. ", "I do not recognise what I see today. A strange glow of warmth.  Consuming the emotion, I'm met with a new perspective, a brightness I have never seen. I am bewildered. I feel ill at ease: my life is different and there are endless possibilities. Bathing in this emotion and the gleeful freedom it brings, I realise I am happy. ", "My realisation comes too late.  The effects wear off. I look at my box which is empty once again; I feel nothing. Once more, I am craving the  sadness that brings me back to life. ", "For the first time in my life, \nI understood why people felt this way.\nAll those times I've been receiving these emotions,\nI finally understand that I've never experienced them.\nThat I've been only feeling them.\nThis time though,\nthis time was my first time experiencing one for myself.\nMy first real emotion.\nRegret.", "I tried bringing an end to the donation box.\nI really did try.\nBut the emptiness, it was too much.\nI kept thinking back to the day I was donated happiness.\nI wish I'd never known happiness.\nI wish I never started this donation box.\nHappiness was the cruelest drug I could have been given, and now I can't go back.\nAnd from that, my regret was born.", "He wakes up.\nBrews his coffee. \nSits at the kitchen table. \nLights a cigarette and puffs away at life. \nYesterday was a pretty rough day. He had obsessed about a woman he had never met. All night long, he kept turning in bed, cold sweats chilling down his spine. His silent screams of fear, of rage, of desperation, left with none but his mind for an audience. \nA burning sensation in his fingers snaps him out of his trance. He jolts from the chair screaming and flicks the cigarette angrily. He sighs, reflecting upon his self inflicted fate.\nDragging his feet behind him, he walks toward the black cabinet. Grabs the black box on the shelf. Carries it to the couch and sits down restlessly. He notices a small crack on one of the edges, staring at it with intrigue. \nProceeding to opening the box, he gets shills all over his body. Heart pounding, heavy breaths, a huge smile paints itself on his face. \nHe cries as never before. \nThis is what happiness tasted like.", "Once again, I'm sitting on the cold sidewalk corner outside that Walgreens peddling for some emotion. I come here often, the whole neighborhood knows of my disability. I'm always asking for a feeling, any feeling, with tears running down my face and paranoia choking back the words in my throat. They always ask me why a life with just other people's sadness and fears is a life worth living, and I tell them the exact same thing: I want to feel something. I want to know how life is supposed to make me feel, even if all they can spare me are the negatives. ", "Out of pity, they donate their useless emotions like chump change-- how they felt when a parent forgot a birthday party, a funeral for their grandfather who died of a heart attack too soon, or when they were left alone in that dark alley in the sketchiest part of town. But one day, a man walked up to me reading the sign aloud, \"I want to feel. Spare any emotion. God Bless.\" Without a word, he reached into the back pocket of his tailored suit and pulled out a clean leather-bound wallet. He pulled out an emotion without looking like it didn't matter which one he was throwing, and passed on the shiniest one I had ever seen. It illuminated the box until it slowly faded and entered my brain. For the first time in my life, I smiled. ", "I felt happiness. I felt satisfied and contentment. The tears are my face were still there, but they didn't feel as salty as they used to. They felt sweeter somehow. They felt the happiness too. The man walked away before I could thank him, but I tried to focus on this emotion. This was the better part of life. The happier part. Eventually, I started to see the memory in my mind. I was about to locate the source of this immense happiness. A man as rich as this must have been having the best day of his life. Why would he pass it to a peasant like me?", "The memory was on a bright Summer day. The sidewalk was blinding from the sunlight, and on it was the man standing in front of another man in an apron. The man, in a different suit this time, was standing with something strange in his mouth. The memory was still blurry as I tried to focus on the object. He didn't look as happy as I did when I received this feeling, but he was smiling nonetheless. ", "And then, suddenly, I saw the object of our happiness, and I immediately understood why he gave me this memory. This memory was just as mundane as most of theirs are. He didn't appreciate the happiness as much as the donators like him fear the sadness. In his mouth was a red hot dog. The wiener filling his stomach like every other Monday, but filling me with a happiness I would never see again.", "A lanky, hard-faced man entered the bright large room, followed by a tiny chestnut brown haired girl. Tea, coffee and biscuits had already been served on the antique tea table at the centre of the room, and Mr. Dreifus was sitting on one of the sofas, happily waiting for the man to arrive. He stood up, bearing a warm grin at his guests, who smiled back at him. \u201cAaron, late as usual! Who is this beautiful lady? She is welcome to stay with us, of course\u201d. The grave look evaporated from Aaron\u2019s face, as he apologised \u201cSorry, Marcus, you know how busy I am. This is Lou\u201d. The girl introduced herself and shook Mr Dreifus hand. He quickly proceeded to pour tea for his guests, while they sat on the sofa opposite him \u201cCall me Marcus, and have a biscuit! I don\u2019t want to enjoy this alone\u201d.", "They all religiously waited for that ritual to be performed, before Aaron spoke again. \u201cLast week you were telling me about your trip to Medford, Marcus. I\u2019d like to hear the rest of the story\u201d. Marcus nodded keenly, shook the crumbs from his trousers and made himself comfortable. \u201cMedford, Oregon. Lou, you probably don\u2019t know, but I grew up there. Medford represents everything good and everything bad in my life, so I had to go back to give it\u2026 one last look, I suppose. I was a troubled, troubled young man, and I experienced all sorts of pain and regret during my teenage years. I am, of course, talking about the box.\u201d he paused to see Lou\u2019s reaction. She looked back at him and nodded; she knew. Marcus sighed and took another biscuit, submerging it in his tea. He took another sip, cleared his throat and went on, gazing out of the window behind his guests. \u201cWhen I left Medford as a young man, my life suddenly started to run smoothly: I got a job, a girlfriend and more friends than I knew what to do with. I felt this glowing joy, which would radiate to everyone I would meet. I could see colours I had never see, cry tears that had a different taste\u2026 I couldn\u2019t even remember the terrible \u2018before\u2019, and it was all thanks to her. She left an address in the box with her happiness, so I knew that she wanted me to find her. So, 48 years ago, 6 years after the gift, I crossed the country to return to Medford. I drove straight to the address, this neat little house with a veranda. There was a window open downstairs, so someone had to be home. I was really anxious, but I felt good. I had even bought presents; a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates\u2026\u201d he stopped and sighed again. Aaron stood up and walked around the room, cracking the window open to let in a cool breeze of fresh air. \u201cI rang and there was no reply. Tried again, without success. I decided to stay the night and try the following day. This time, someone answered. It was a woman in her fifties who I soon found out was the housekeeper. She let me in, but the moment I explained who I was, she was evidently embarrassed. She called a name, \u201cSuzanne\u201d, and before leaving, she invited me to sit in the living room. ", "She appeared after several minutes. I barely realised that she had entered the room, as she seemed to gently float like a ghost. This old, fragile looking woman stood in front of me. I didn\u2019t know what to do or say. I wanted to greet her, talk and present my gifts, but our meeting was brief. She told me that the person I was looking for was her daughter. She had given me her happiness when she was 19. She had always had an unstable mood, the doctors suspected that she had bipolar disorder, and when she gave me part of her, she fell into a severe depression. She hanged herself in a nearby park a couple of days later. For the first time in 6 years, I no longer felt happy. The woman was very sweet and tried to reassure me that I wasn\u2019t responsible for what happened, but I wasn\u2019t convinced. I never thought there could be consequences. People mostly exploited my box in order to get rid of their bad feelings, but this young girl had gotten rid of her joy. Was it an accident, or did her disease push her to do it? I will never know. I left Medford soon after, and my life changed once again.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Aaron spoke up. \u201cThank you, Marcus. We\u2019ll be back very soon\u201d. Marcus finished his tea and smiled at Lou, who was visibly shaken. \u201cCan I show her the box at least? It\u2019s just there\u201d said, while pointing at a cabinet in one angle of the room. \u201cYou are probably curious about it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Lou was going to reply, but Aaron gestured for her to leave, while saying goodbye to Marcus.", "\u201cDr. Norris, I have several questions about Mr Dreifus\u201d said Lou, struggling to match Aaron\u2019s pace. \u201cNot now, Lou. I have to see another patient. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Don\u2019t think about it too much, OK?\u201d. Lou went to collect her bag and change out of her scrubs. She had already discussed the case with Dr. Norris, the elderly schizophrenic with a history of hallucinations, who believed that his feelings were determined by a box. Nevertheless, hearing the story first hand from such a friendly, smart man\u2026\nLou walked through the ward, but she couldn\u2019t avoid to give one last look at Mr. Dreifus\u2019 room: it was open and empty. The teacups were still on the table, the window was still open, but Mr. Dreifus was no longer there. Her gaze fell on the cabinet in the corner, the one that Mr. Dreifus had pointed out. Lou shook her head as she approached it. \u201cThis is crazy\u201d she thought as she grasped the handle and heaved it open. On the shelf was a shiny blue metal box. She took it out: it felt heavy and robust. Her heart raced as she opened the latch.", "\u201cDon\u2019t open it!\u201d ", "Lou gasped and spun around aghast. As the box fell and opened, Mr. Dreifus\u2019 smile turned into a terrified expression.", "I can feel the memories, and its completely different. It's not despair, but it tastes like it. It tastes... melancholy? No. That's more bitter. This is sweet, but.. there's something about it...", "Another one... This one even more powerful... So strong it hurts, but it's a delicious pain. Addicting, and I want more. I think I begin to understand why he wanted to be rid of these... What is this feeling called?! Maybe his memories of this emotion will bring me the answer.", "I can't take it. This feeling. I need more, I doubt I'll ever be filled. I need this, thing. This... love.", "I race up to find the young man, shoving aside crowds. I recognize all the emotions I see: irritation, frustration, anger. I've had all of those before. But none of those can quench this love thing. ", "And there he is. His head is higher than it was, but somehow empty. I can't understand it... How can he be happier without these emotions?", "\"Why?\" I ask him. \"Why would you ever give this up?\"", "He grimaces at me, and explains. \"Have you ever heard that it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all? It's not true... You think you know joy? You've never felt more joy than spending a perfect day with the perfect person. But true pain isn't about what happens. It's about what's taken away.\"", "\"She was pregnant. He would have been one year old today. I don't blame him, or the doctors who tried everything they could. I don't blame the gods, or my fate, or even myself. I don't blame anyone. But now they're both gone, and the pain of what I've lost hurts more than the pain of what happened. I can't bear it anymore. My friends told me that you take emotions: sadness, fear, regret. So I hoped you would take my pain for me too...\"", "If you cannot feel emotions, live feels bland, meaningless.\nI had no focus, lived without actually living.\nThat's why he talked me into putting up that box.", "Quickly people came and filled it with their emotions.\nI would say that I was overjoyed, but I obviously wasn't.", "Darkness, it's all I know now. \nIt's like people spitting on beggars. People donated their nightmares, their insecurities, their love for the deceased.", "Maybe it was the endless stream of depression and misery that turned me sinister, maybe it was always in me, or maybe it was just another donated emotion. \nIt doesn't matter.", "I can't look into the mirror anymore. \nI can't...........\nThere is only one thing I can still do.", "I knew god considers suicide a sin, but after being constantly terrified for eternity, even that cannot scare me anymore.", "As the blood left my veins, first flowing, later only dripping, I felt my life vanishing with it as my very essence mixed with the clouds beneath me, turning them to crimson.", "\"You know what future waits for sinners\", his voice echoed from all sides. \"You shall be banished, Lucifer\".", "I forgot about the box. After so many years, I embraced the terror, became one with it, led it guide my emotions.", "People kept on throwing their worst at me, and I threw it back at them. Droughts, Famines.", "But today, a man made it thew the crack that connects this place to the mortal realm, sneaked past my guards and made it to my thrown.", "I sighed \"Another adventurer trying to kill me?\"", "He just shook his head", "\"Ah, wanting my three golden wisps of hair?\"", "He shook it again.", "\"I just wanted to give this to you personally\", he said.", "Before I could smite he had stepped up to me and.....", "....and hugged me.", "In this moment the eons of torment left me through my eyes. Crying enough to fill entire oceans, but he didn't turn away. Not even my disgusting looks, shaped by hell, could scare him away.", "Everyday is terrible. Wake up, lash out, break down, sleep, wake up, lash out, break down. I used to think of it showing up in my patreon as the best day I ever lived. I know better now. Wake up, lash out, break down, sleep. It's all the same as it used to be, but now it's worse. ", "\"I don't deserve this\", I said to myself as the decades of built up anger, rage and frustration mercilessly pounded it back into my minds abyss, and before it even had a chance, it was gone.", "The generous old man looked hopeful before, but now he looks terrified.", "Light creeps across the room as I stare at the ceiling. Day in and day out, it's the same old shit. I would apologize for my cynicism but I couldn't care less. I guess it's good that these people don't want to deal with their negativity anymore and I can take on the burden, but Jesus Christ I'm tired. I don't sleep for fear I'll only wake to my own screaming, I don't do anything because God knows I'd just regret it in the end. I'd cry, but I'm out. I'm dry. I have nothing left to give. But at least they don't have to deal with it anymore. I'd rather feel this than nothing. \nI get up from the floor - why bother with a bed when it's not comforting? - and reach to shut the blinds, screw the sun, when my arm warms up at the rays. ...What? I turn my arm over, waiting for the sensation to go away, but it keeps creeping up, a spreading warmth, an... energy? My eyes carefully drift upward and look outside. I notice that birds are chirping on the railing of my balcony for the first time. Something flutters in my chest and I panic - I'm having some kind of heart attack! But nothing bad happens. Instead of collapsing, encompassed in pain and agony until the darkness surrounds me, a gentle warmth spreads with each flutter, like ripples through water, and my face starts to hurt. I reach my hands up to my mouth and it's making the oddest shape... \nI run over to the mirror, wipe all the dust off, and squint to look at the face I haven't seen in years. My mouth looks like a U - they called it a smile I think. But, how? I look around and see the light, the birds, and open the window - fresh breeze blows in, dislodging dust from nearly every surface, and my eyes begin to water. I'm.... happy. That's the word. Happy. I'm happy! \nBut who would ever give this up? This gorgeous subtlety. \nI look down toward my donation box and see a note taped to it - someone must finally understand my problem! I rush down the stairs of my apartment building, thinking of all the notes I've gotten about this is \"such a great performance piece\" and how I should \"talk to the local art college\" or, worse, \"just get a fucking job\" - finally, maybe someone understood! Eager, I tear the note from it's tape and nearly rip it in the process, and read the words like a monk stranded in the desert would drink water: ", "I don't know if this is fake but it's worth a shot. Anything is at this point. I don't want it anymore. I can't carry it anymore. It hurts too much. She's dead, and there's nothing I can do about it, nothing I could ever do would bring her, the happiness she brought me, back. Take this wretched happiness of her memory away from me, all it does is cause me more pain. Maybe now I can finally be numb. ", "A water droplet hits the paper and flinch, pulled out of the note, and look up to see if it's raining - still sunny - and realize it's my own tear. I'm crying; tears of my own, because I've known sadness, and now, because of this person, I've known happiness - I only wish I could tell him that feeling nothing isn't worth giving up all of the pain in the world... \nI hear a clunk as someone stares across my box at me, going from deadpan to tranquil within seconds, as a feeling of inadequacy engulfs the sunshine of happiness that had, minutes ago, pulsated through me - they gave me apathy, how fitting. Crumpling the note, I toss it in the trash on my way back into the apartment building, to my dull, dusty life that doesn't even matter. It's not like I could've done anything for that guy anyways. ", "You'd think at least my parents would have at least given me some of their happiness.  They only shared pain, especially dad.  School was even worse.  As soon as the other kids knew everyone would dump all of their despair for me to carry.  They all seemed nice though, they always said thank you, too bad I couldn't feel any appreciation.", "No love, no hope, nothing.  Nothing but shit.  ", "And boy could I feel the shit.  The bullies, the bullied, the nasty teachers, the criminal on the stolen bike, the thieves, the murderer.  I did have a lot of so called friends though, but they would always turn on me to escape their own pain.  Once they dropped off their last ounce of shame from crushing me even further, they'd leave.  I always felt that.", "College was proving to be just the same.  I couldn't wait to get out and start my engineering job so I could just stop fucking talking to people.  It was hard to study with all of that weight on my mind and knowing the only thing I'd get to feel each day would hurt.  I failed statistics three times.  I even walked the graduation stage twice because I had thought I had passed.", "It was a new semester, my last semester.  One way or another.  They gave us a group assignment.  Great.  I could already tell these people sucked, except her.  Instead she looked at me right away saw the same pain inside both of us, as special people tend to do.   I saw it in her eyes too but they were also brimming with something else I that couldn't  explain.  Something not shitty.  ", "She didn't make any donations, we just talked.  I told her everything.  She told me about her abusive father, the bullies she faced from constantly being the new kid in school.   She told me about the thugs and what they did to her when she was just a kid.

Mom and dad didn't talk about it much, but we knew. The visits slowed after they put her in the home. A couple of my cousins and I would take turns visiting after school and taking her out to do her grocery shopping and run errands, so we noticed when she had her good days and her bad days. The bad started outweighing the good, and eventually, we knew we would get the call. ", "That call came three days ago. ", "Now, I'm sitting in the limo with my brothers, mom, dad, and for some reason, Aunt Jenn. Dad's sister and their families are in the car behind us. No one is saying anything, which is weird. Mom always is on her phone with her assistant and the office. Dad is usually discussing some new development from the university he and my brother Steve have been working on. And Mikey is usually listening to his music. Today... silence. But not really. For the day being relatively cold and overcast, there's lots of people outside. And the number of people seem to be growing the closer we get to grandma's church. She was adamant about having her service at the church she and grandpa married in, saying she started her life there and she would damn well make sure she ended it there. So now here we are. On our way to that stuffy chapel that always smelled slightly of mothballs, dead flowers, and wood polish. Steve's asthma will be acting up by the time we hit the eulogy.

Suddenly, there's a camera crew racing up to our car, and the local news team is waiting for us to open the doors and step out. What the hell is going on here?!", "Taking a breath, my dad opens the door and pandemonium rains down upon us all as hundreds of people start applauding and chanting my and my cousins names. Steve and Mike look at me, and I look back at them with equal confusion. ", "\"We love Mary!\" Someone randomly yells.  \"Do you have her blueberry cobbler recipe?\" we hear further back. I'm lost. ", "As we step out, the camera crew moves in and there's a microphone in my dad's face. ", "\"Mr. McEwan, how are you feeling today with the crowds here for your mother? Were you aware of her popularity?\" My dad just stumbles. \"Her popularity? What are you people talking about?\" \"Surely you were aware of your mother's online presence? She's made millions through her social media presence.\" ", "\"Social media? Oh my god, was my mother on the Facechat thing?\" My dad looks horrified. Mom looks furious. She's already pulled herself away and is on the phone now with the office. The first and only normal thing I've seen her do today. I can hear her trying to figure out where this could be a security breach or PR something and demanding HR get on this. The usual...", "Mikey pulls out his phone and I see him search Mary McEwan. Instantly HUNDREDS of articles pop up... mostly YouTube but also Twitter (which provided links to the other accounts) and Instagram (user name \"InstaGramGram1938\"). ", "\"Uhhh dad, guys... you may want to see this.\" Mikey looks like any 17 year old boy would when finding out his Gran had a better grasp on tech than he did. It turns out, Gran had started a YouTube cooking show from her iPad about cooking healthy and extravagant meals while on a fixed income! It was brilliant! She had millions of followers, all ranging from high school graduates and college kids, to single parents and other pensioners. My brothers and I were flabbergasted. Especially since my brothers and I had all pitched in to get her the iPad for Christmas two years ago so she could play her card games and FaceTime us when we couldn't visit in person. ", "\"My mom... was famous?!\" My dad says, having torn himself away from the tv crew. My brothers look up to find we've somehow been ushered into the back of the church while we were immersed in our discovery. I'm so shocked I don't even remember moving. ", "Steve piped up, \"Wait, if she has THIS many followers who've watched these videos, Gran would have been making some money from some of these.\" We kind of smiled because it's a social media platform... how much money could that have been, right? As we wait for the service to start in the back room, my family watch some of Gran's videos. For the first time in awhile, my family laughed, cried, and reminisced together as Gran was on the screen, talking about her family as she made appetizers, desserts, and her famous meatloaf. She also had videos and photos of all her grandkids, and stories of their visits and accomplishments. She talked of the time we went for ice cream and fed the ducks down by pond, and how we talked about me going to college... all while she was teaching other college students how to darn holes in socks on video. She said she got the idea for the show that day, when she and I talked about budgeting and being independent. I was amazed. On this day, a day I was heart broken over and my family was detached, gran brought us back together one more time. ", "As we were there smiling together and discovering our gran's secret, the priest came in to tell us it was time, and that we had a full house... plus hundreds more outside that they had to set up a sound system for. As a family, we stood up, stowed the show for the moment, and followed the priest out of the room and through the church, to go visit GranGran one last time. ", "I fidget in my seat and tug at the hemline of my skirt, trying to bring it past my knees. Grandma was very traditional and although she never said it, she had never approved of my dress sense. Today I look nothing like myself. My usual pastel colours have muted to black and grey in mourning. My mother sits beside me in the black cab, stuck in typical London traffic. She fiddles with the orders of service crammed into her purse and rocks my sleeping baby brother on her shoulder. Two dozen of them, enough spares for any members of the congregation who had seen the obituary in the Church newsletter. Before her passing, Grandma had picked out some of her favourite hymns to be sung at the service. A few of them were in Latin, and I suggested to my parents that we ought to take them out because it would only be the family in attendance, and none of us knew the words. But mother had insisted, 'Grandma liked things a particular way, Rosemary, we ought to respect that.'", "We had never been particularly close, Grandma and I, mostly because she hated to travel anywhere she couldn't walk to and was too deaf to properly hold a conversation on her rotary dial landline phone. Things had gotten somewhat better when we had given her my old computer, but even when we skyped her, she'd pick up one of the computer speakers and shout into it the whole time. She had been delighted to receive it, though. It was the one modern convenience that she actually embraced. She said that the keyboard reminded her of her days as a secretary, typing on an expensive typewriter. She would type and print her grocery lists every day, and every last Sundays of the month, when we brought her down to Brighton for Roast Lunch, she would bring a different dish and delight to us about how ", " had been ever so helpful, finding her new recipes, helping her to figure out how to work her DVD player, and generally keeping her in high spirits. A few times I had tried to explain to her that there was more to the internet than a search engine, but it was lost upon her. She was happy enough with just her friendly gentleman, Jeeves. At some point, she must have cracked Amazon, because she would let us know of deliveries from Mr Jeeves. It shocked us to hear that she had embraced online shopping, given her aversion to online banking; she was afraid that a 'computer flu' would wipe out her savings accounts.", "\"Just around this corner, ma'am?\" The cabbie asks.", "\"Yes, thank you. It's a little Church, tucked away. Easy to miss.\"", "\"You might be better off walking, ma'am. There seems to be a lot of foot traffic, I don't think I'll get all the way down the road.\" He suggests.", "\"Oh goodness, is there a protest or something going on today, Rosie?\" Mother asks. Not that I know of.", "\"Mum, they're all wearing black, have the Church double booked another funeral?\" I ask. It isn't a big Church at all, and most members were elderly. Was it possible that they had misprinted the funeral details and invited mourners of another person to Grandma's funeral?", "\"Go on ahead and see what's going on at the Church, please, while I settle your brother.\" The noise of the crowd is bothering him. What are so many people doing in this sleepy corner of North London?", "I get out of the car and a girl with purple hair wearing a long black dress bumps into me and I drop my purse, the contents spilling out. \"Sorry, so sorry!\" She apologises in a thick German accent.", "\"That's okay,\" I tell her, as she helps me to gather my phone and wallet from between the feet of the passing crowd. \"What's this gathering?\" I ask.", "\"Oh, we are here for Granny Merideth's funeral service.\" She tells me. I'm shocked. She looks no older than me and clearly isn't from around here.", "\"", " Grandma Merideth?\" I ask, in shock.", "\"Oh! Are you little Rosie-Posie?\" She beams at me.", "\"How did you... how do you know my Grandma?\" I demand, a bit stunned. Is this some sort of practical joke?", "\"She's the Twitter Granny! She chats to us all the time on Twitter. Hey, everybody! It's Granny's Rosie-Posie!\" She shrieks, jumping up and down while pointing me out to the crowd. People all around us stop and stare, murmurs of excitement rising from the crowd.", "\"What are you all talking about?\" I ask, confused.", "\"I think it must have started about two years ago,\" someone piped up. \"Granny started tweeting asking someone named Jeeves for help operating the microwave, so someone tweeted her back with instructions and she kept coming back to twitter with questions and sometimes just for a chat. She's so sweet and so adorable. We were heartbroken when she tweeted, asking 'Jeeves' how to print out lyrics to hymns to pass on to her daughter as suggestions for her funeral. She let us know in her last few days that she was nearing the end of her life and invited 'Mr Jeeves' to come and pay his last respects, so we all came. The service is being live streamed to her over sixteen million followers.\"", "Someone shoved an iPad under my nose, and there it was, my old twitter account, with 16.4 million followers, over twenty thousand tweets, and a long stream of my Grandmother's conversations with 'Jeeves' about all sorts of things.", "'Mr Jeeves, what sort of seeds do you suggest I purchase for the lovely birds who sing so sweetly outside my window?'", "'Mr Jeeves, it has been snowing quite heavily in England, I heard on the Radio. Are you alright?'", "'Mr Jeeves, I thought you might know, what time does the new grocery store on Griffith Avenue in Galway close this evening?'", "'Mr Jeeves, I'm in my later years, I feel like I wasted so much time. I wish I had a legacy to leave behind for my grandchildren.'", "It seemed that Grandma had left her legacy to millions after all. Sweet, lovely Granny Merideth.", "\"It's him.\" That's what I heard someone say as I pushed myself through the crowd. Was I getting paranoid? I was almost sure of what I heard. Did these people know me?\nI had a weird feeling ever since I had to get out of my car hundreds of meters away from the cemetery. The street was packed with people and here and there was a car.  All randomly parked in the middle of the street. Seems like I wasn't the only one who gave up and had to abandon the vehicle.\n'What are they all doing here anyways?' This question shot through my head for the second or third time. Was there another demonstration going on? I don't really follow these anymore. Haven't been in one for a lot of years.

Was there an Asian group dressed in white?\nConfused, I decided to ignore it and went to the gates.\nIt seems there were more and more people the closer I got. \n\"Figures.\"I thought. \"It wasn't a good day to begin with.

A long, red cape flowed past a soft, furry body. A steel helmet sat atop his head. Two soft ears poked out of holes in the helmet. A sword rattled against his hips. A great chorus of cheers and salutations followed Sir Mittens as he walked out of the castle. He strode, proud, into the thick forest which ringed the castle. The King and his court watched from balconies up high. Pride swelled in their chests.", "The forest came up to meet Sir Mittens. The dense overgrowth soon surrounded the noble kitten. The cheers of the castle died down as the thicket grew ever denser around Sir Mittens. The brave kitty was soon surrounded by the peaceful quiet of the forest. Birds chirped, leaves rustled, insects cricked and frogs croaked. A soft stream babbled somewhere nearby.", "The ground beneath Sir Mittens soft, pink paws started to slope upwards. With an adorable, and very scratchable chin held high, Sir Mittens walked. The slope broke out of the dense forest, and Sir Mittens ascended the incline.", "The slope left behind the thick green of the forest. Sir Mittens was quickly surrounded by rocky mountains and spires. He climbed, agile and patient, up the mountain. Above him, a great cavern was carved into the mountainside. Sir Mittens saw the mouth of the cave, and narrowed his eyes. His paws moved expertly as he traversed the rocky slope. His goal was in sight.", "Reaching a pink paw up in the air, Sir Mittens grabbed the lip of the cave. He pulled himself up, and soon stood at the edge of this mountain cavern. The midday sun beat into the cave, illuminating it. Just on the edge of his vision, Sir Mittens could see glittering piles of gold and treasure.", "Sir Mittens took several careful steps into the cave. His tail swished softly behind him as he stalked forward. From within the cave, Sir Mittens could hear a breathing. A great, hot gust of air blew past Sir Mittens.", "Suddenly, the ground started to shake beneath Sir Mittens\u2019 paws. Deep within the cave, there was a tremendous rustling. Sir Mittens spread his hind legs out, and readied himself. He felt the impact of massive, taloned feet approaching him from within the dark.", "A great, scaly head appeared before Sir Mittens. A giant bearded dragon, easily towering over Sir Mittens\u2019 feline form, emerged from the depths of the cave. It stood in front of Sir Mittens, and let out a great roar.", "Sir Mittens stared up at the bearded dragon. The two creatures locked eyes. A smile spread across the bearded dragon\u2019s reptilian face. The great lizard laid on its belly, and extended its head out towards Sir Mittens. Sir Mittens padded towards the lizard, and raised a paw.", "With the softest of pats, Sir Mittens petted the giant bearded dragon. The bearded dragon purred softly.", "\u201cKing Meow sends me, Sir Mittens, to give you a message, Oh Great One.\u201d Sir Mittens said softly to the lizard.", "The bearded dragon continued to purr contentedly as Sir Mittens\u2019 continued to pet its head. Sir Mittens leaned his head in towards the lizard\u2019s ear. He was so close that some of his whiskers touched the reptile\u2019s scales. He whispered quietly.", "\u201cThe King says you\u2019re a good boy/\u201c", "The bearded dragon let out a satisfied purr, and Sir Mittens wrapped his soft arms around the dragon\u2019s neck, embracing the great beast in an act of friendship and loving respect.", "Hope you enjoyed the story!

They've spent a lot of time and energy learning to sit in the most comfortable and pleasing of ways. The man could learn a lot from the cat.", "The man spent most of his day harried and stressed. He had to be at work early or he would be late. He had to do his work or it wouldn't get done and when he wasn't working he was always worried that they would be understaffed and he would get called in. The man never rested fully.", "The cat rested like it was his job. The cat languished. It played when it fancied. If someone from outside decided to observe they would say \"The cat has it worked out,\" and they would be right.", "The man, when he thought about it, was jealous of the cat and it's ability to have life worked out. The cat was a bit fat, it had a purr that let people know it was content and it's sleek, fluffy fur invited others to pet it.", "The man had a sigh, he used it to let people know it was unhappy.", "One day the man came home from work and found the cat was unhappy. Far from being happy about the cats unhappiness, as would be normal if the cat had been any other being the man was concerned. He changed the cats water and he filled the cats food bowl.", "The cat remained unhappy, it paced back and forth at the door looking outside.", "Outside, unseen by the man was a lizard.", "The cat thought it was taunting him. It wasn't.", "The lizard was content, it had a garden to frolick in and dart about and large flat rocks on which it could lie soaking in the sun. When it looked like it would rain or  some bird-like beast would seize it and carry it up it had shady nooks and crannies in which it could hide.", "It didn't really know what up was. Just that if it went up it wouldn't come down again and it would miss this garden in which it had decided it would live with plenty of food, the sun's rays heating it and a small pool which attracted lots of it's favourite food.", "The lizard's presence however made the cat unhappy. It meowed and whined whenever the lizard, who had no idea that the cat even existed, lay out on his favourite rock and sunned himself.", "On those days the man was unhappier, eventually he decided that he couldn't take the cat's restlessness anymore and decided to go and sit in the garden.", "There he pulled out a chair and a book and he sat. He rested in the sun and let the rays soak him as he enjoyed a story of a man who beat his boss in a game of poker taking over his business and making his boss do his job.", "He realised he had enjoyed it so much that he built a shed out there and it became a part of his day. He would go and sit outside, enjoy a glass of wine and read a book that made him feel better about his life.", "One day whilst he was imagining what he would make his boss do if their positions were reversed he saw the lizard. The lizard had scurried out and grabbed a big fat bug.", "The man was hungry. He ordered himself some pizza because who had the time these days to cook for oneself? He gave a slice to his cat, who turned up it's nose and wandered off to look for something better, like a small mouse. Or a ball of dust. He went outside and left a small piece outside for the lizard.", "In the morning the pizza was gone and he decided that the lizard must have enjoyed it. In this way he went about his day, sharing his meal with the lizard and making sure the cat was happy.", "The man was happy.", "The cat, getting extra attention, but having freedom in the house, even when the man was home was happy.", "The lizard, knowing that food was easy to get and the sun would always warm him, was happy.", "Dense flakes of snow fell from the sky", "and Mittens the kitten looked up with a sigh.", "His pillow was cold!", "And though he wasn't yet old", "The chill in his bones made him cry.", "He shifted away from his seat by the pane", "and leapt up to see where his neighbor had lain.", "Freckle the gecko had all the best stuff,", "which made living near him a little bit tough.", "Freckle's tank was warmed not by the sun", "but instead by light which shone with the promise of fun.", "Mittens' little black paws padded soft on the ground", "as he prepared to give the side of the tank a good pound.", "He crouched down real low and swished wide with his tail", "while Freckles darted behind a plant with a quick flail.", "And just when he was about to pounce...", "suddenly, he couldn't move even an ounce!", "Scooped up by two hands and pulled tight to a chest", "Mittens found himself tucked into a vest.", "He was no longer cold so he settled down with a purr", "And wound his claws in the yarn so he stuck like a burr.", "His owner minded not the tears in her sweater.", "She had three more in her closet which were even better.", "When her grandmother called she would tell a little white lie", "And explain that she'd loved it in a tone very blithe", "But cats will be catty", "They're a little bit batty", "Maybe, next year, she could just send a pie.", "Sadie pets Foxy who feeds her four kittens in the mostly empty garage. The kittens are five weeks old, their eyes are open, and they're walking everywhere. Foxy is a grey and black tabby cat while her kittens are a mix, one grey and black tabby, a long haired grey and white kitten with blue eyes, and an orange and yellow tabby. The final one is a pure black kitten. Sadie sees the first three, but the black kitten isn't there. ", "Sadie scans the garage, but the sunlight is fading. Sadie turns on the light and looks around the garage, checking every nook and cranny. She searches for the black kitten, but it is not there. Sadie opens the door into the house and looks around. The kitten isn't there either. Sadie looks for her mom and dad. She finds her dad and tugs on his pants. ", "\"What is it Princess?\" ", "\"One of the kittens is gone.\" ", "\"Oh no. Let's go find it.\" ", "The dad takes her hand, and they head back to the garage. He looks at the kittens who now cuddle with Foxy. He counts them quick as Foxy stands up and heads to the door that leads outside. ", "\"Three only. The black kitten is missing.\" ", "Foxy paws at the door. Sadie runs over and opens it. As soon as the door opens, Sadie and her dad hear it. Foxy runs outside, and they follow her. The mewing grows louder, but the day has turned into night. The dad pulls out his phone and uses it like a flashlight. ", "Foxy runs to an evergreen tree and disappears under it. She circles the tree as the dad looks under it, but the mewing comes from above. He shines the light and sees the kitten a couple of feet above him. He fights his way into the tree, but he can't reach the kitten. ", "\"Sadie, I need your help.\"", "\"Okay, daddy.\"  ", "Foxy meows at her kitten. The dad lifts Sadie on his shoulders and fights his way into the tree again. The needles dig into his skin a little, but he pushes through. Sadie sees the kitten and reaches out to grab it. The kitten is afraid, but she picks it up gently and pulls it to her chest. ", "\"Got 'em?\"", "\"Yes.\" ", "The dad pulls away from the tree and lifts Sadie off of his shoulders and places her on the ground. She sets the kitten down who runs to its mom. Foxy picks up the kitten by the scruff and brings her back to the garage, reunited with the other kittens. The dad and Sadie play with the reunited family for a little bit. The dad hugs his daughter, and she hugs him back. ", "\"What's going on out here?\" Asks the mom. ", "They both turn to look at her. She walks out and looks at the kittens then Sadie and then her husband. ", "\"What happened to you?\" She asks with a smile. ", "\"Well, it's a tale of courage, a mother's search for her child and a princess turned heroine. Quite the adventure.\"  ", "\"Well, you can tell me about it over supper.\" ", "Sadie pats Foxy again before heading inside. ", "If you enjoyed this, I have other stories at ", ".", "At the blue house on Winter Park Street, the Slightly Under Numbered Lizards were having a discussion in the basement.", "The lizards gathered around the mildly damaged paint can, and blinked nervously at each other. One munched loudly on a fly. Murmurs shifted across the room.", "Slightly Green Tailed stood up on the can, holding onto the tail that gave him his name for comfort. \"Brothers and sisters!\" He squeaked. \"I know there has been some discussion-\"", "\"Discussion! It has been a riot!\" Lost An Eye growled. The crowd murmured in agreement.", "\"There has been ", ",\" Slightly Green Tailed continued, speaking over the discontented voices hurriedly and emphasizing a capital D on discussion, \"about our current contract with Waffles.\"", "There was hisses and boos from the crowd. \"He hasn't been keeping his end of the bargain!\" An angry voice came from the back of the room. ", "\"He hasn't been pulling his weight at all!\" Another lizard who sounded unfortunately like Slightly Green Tailed's wife called out.  ", "\"And that's saying a lot considering how fat he has got.\" The small Foot Kinda Dangly said reproachfully from the front of the crowd.", "Laughs and sneers followed that statement, and Slightly Green Tailed sighed wearily. \"We have been trying to reach out in negotiations- \"", "\"Negotiations?\" Lost An Eye laughed mockingly, \"Negotiations? With that fluffy abomination? He is unreasonable! He ate our offerings, and disappeared! How are we supposed to deal with that?\"", "Slightly Green Tailed hesitated, and then looked dejectedly at the half blind lizard. \"Why are you making this hard for me?\"", "Suddenly, there was a creak of flap, and a shout came from the back of the crowd. \"It's Waffles!\" The meeting of lizards immediately fell silent.", "The fat ginger cat waddled down the stairs, it's long fur creating a cloud of floof as he descended into the basement. Almond eyes glinted as he surveyed the scattering of lizards, then a small ", " in greeting escaped his orange lips. He purred, \"Sorry, friends. But the lady upstairs accidentally blocked the cat door down here. But she fixed it and now I am here. Do you have any flies?\"", "There was a cheer, and the lizards immediately swarmed forward. Waffles chuckled, and rolled onto his back into a pile of clean laundry, exposing a tummy that radiated heat. The lizards immediately cuddled into his long fur.", "\"It's so warm!\" Foot Kinda Dangly murmured, voice disappearing into fluff.", "\"He's the squishiest, warmest monster that never ate us, ever.\" Lost An Eye agreed.", "Slightly Green Tailed walked up to the cat, and patted his nose. \"Thanks for coming back, friend. The basement was getting very cold. Lizards were starting to panic, and we get a bit dumb when the temperature drops. But we still managed to get some flies for you.\" ", "Waffles grinned, and bumped his head against the lizard's. \"Anytime, Greeny.\"", "And then with a sigh, the Slightly Under Numbered Lizards and Waffles the ginger cat closed their eyes for a warm nap in the basement, at the blue house on Winter Park Street.", "Today was the day. It was going to happen. He was going to eat that lizard.", "It was in the same spot it always was during sunny afternoons -- on the windowsill, eyes shut, body stretched out in the bright warmth. Stupid lizard, sitting in ", " spot, basking in ", " sunlight. The Lady was a good and kind Lady, but sometimes he wondered if she was a little crazy for willingly allowing a pest to live in the house.", "He crept closer, slowly, paws inching along the cool wooden floor. He didn't dare make a sound. Closer... closer...", "The lizard blinked open one beady eye.", "He froze.", "Several heartbeats later, the lizard resumed its nap. ", "The last few feet to the window were tedious. Still, he dared not rush. Today was the day he was going to catch that lizard, and the only way to do that was with patience and careful planning. Finally, as he belly-crept up to the baseboard, he gathered his strength and prepared to spring -- and then front door opened.", "A booming bark! A skitter of nails! The scent of ", "! He hissed and spitted in terror as the giant monster crashed into the house like a thunderstorm. The Lady entered behind the Monster, shouting and trying to catch the beast. The Monster crossed the living room in a single bound, its long and springy tail making short work of the terrarium on the napping table. ", "\"Chance! No! Down!\" Lady shrieked, but it was too late.", "The monster named 'Chance' was on top of him in the blink of an eye. On sheer instinct, he lashed out with his claws, but his paw might as well have been a cotton ball against the monster's large snout. Chance's gaping maw descended on him in retaliation... and he gaped in horror as a long, wet tongue dragged across the entire front of his body. ", "He yowled in horror and disgust. With the dirtiest of looks, he spat out another hiss and sprang up onto the windowsill, thankfully outside of the Monster's reach. ", "The lizard looked at him, a cold grin spreading across those reptilian lips. \"Welcome to preydom. Fun, isn't it?\"", "The clock was rounding midnight as I was reading another article and my husband, Andy, was playing a video game with his friends. I was taking a pause to think about what I was reading when I hear a rapping on our mail box. I looked at my husband and asked, \"Did you hear that? Is someone trying to mess with our mail?\" He shrugged and said he didn't hear anything. ", "\"Right and ", " the one going deaf, psh.\"", "I get up and grab the Mag-Light from the bookshelf. You see, we don't live in a good neighbourhood, so I wouldn't doubt someone was would be trying to take our mail, trash, scope the place out for a future robbery, and I wanted to at least have something heavy and blinding to defend my self. ", "I slowly turn the knob on the front door, trying to not make a sound just in case someone was there. I open the door a crack and see no one. I look to the the right, toward mail box, and see a rather large grasshopper. It had to be about five or six inches long. It was crawling around as I was looking in awe when a blur jumped right into my field of view making the mail box rattle like I heard before. I look down and see a scrawny calico cat. I gasp and let out in barely a whisper, \"Oh my god a kitty!\"", "I open the screen door and slowly walk out on to the front porch. I kneel near the cat and sit there for a bit, observing her. She lets out the most alley cat meow I had ever heard. It was weak, but strong. A rasp, but not a cry. I stick out my hand in hopes that she'd come near. She took a few steps back before coming head first into my palm. I sat on the ground with her as she circled me begging for more pets. She was emaciated, with her hip bones and spine showing clearly through her skin. Her face a gaunt making her eyes look even bigger than they were. Her skin was tight and fur was surprisingly clean, for an alley cat. ", "As she was getting scritches from me she broke her gaze and looked toward the giant grasshopper, but he had made his escape. She was hunting it before I had interrupted. I knew I had to feed her because it was my fault she didn't get to eat. I wracked my brain thinking if I had something to feed a cat that wouldn't make her sick. All I could think of was the dog food for my pups. I figured it would have to do for the time being. ", "I picked her up while talking to her softly, telling her it was okay. I held her for a minute, but I could tell it was uncomfortable for her. She was so skinny she couldn't find the right way to be held. I decided to hold onto her the best I could and try to make it through my house. She became more fidgety as I came closer to the door. She was so unsure of what was beyond, as she'd never been in a house. My dogs were going absolutely wild as soon as they saw her. One was wagging her tail and barking in excitement to see a new potential friend. Another was barking at the stranger in my arms because she's intruding. The other was angry barking because he is a brat. ", "I ran to our room, as the kitty hissed at the mess of dogs going round my feet. I quickly shut our bedroom door to keep the dogs from causing more stress. I held the cat close to my chest hoping to soothe her as I called for my husband to take his attention away from his game for a second. ", "\"Andy....\"", "\"Maaaaawwwwo,\" she meowed.  ", "\"Yeah? Wait, what?!\" He exclaimed as he did a double take. ", "\"She made that noise outside, and she's really hungry, can I give her some dog food?\"", "\"Uhhh, sure. You know what happens though.\"", "\"Yeah but I feel bad because I accidentally chased off her meal tonight, and she's just skin and bones.\"", "\"Okay,\" he said as he got up to take a closer look. \"She's a real cutie huh?\"", "\"Yeah, okay I'm gonna put the dogs in here while she eats, so they don't bother her.\" I said as I opened the door. ", "The dogs went into the room with no problem as their new friend/intruder/attention grabber was in there, and I was able to quickly close the door on them as the cat gave one last hiss. ", "I grabbed a handful of dog food and set her down on the floor of the kitchen she sniffed it and looked at me. I held some in my hand and held it up to her. She sniffed it some more and gingerly picked up one piece. While she was busy with that I grabbed a bowl and filled it with water. I came back to see her eating like it was the first time she ever ate. I put the bowl down and she started lapping it up immediately. I grabbed one more handful of dog food for her, not wanting her to get sick, and put it into a bowl. When she was done with the food on the ground she walked to the door and meowed. She was still unsure of being inside a house. ", "I picked up the food and water and opened the door to let her out. I made sure she watched where I left the food so that she knew she would always have some sort of meal and clean water. ", "I didn't see her for a few days but the food and water were always gone every morning. I was hoping she was the one eating and drinking it, but it could have been raccoons too. One day I went out into the backyards and there she was on my trash bins. She meowed excitedly and shoved her head into my hands. I got the food and water dishes from the front and set her up in the backyard. She seemed to have set her self up in an old wooden crate I had forgotten about. Andy was happy to see her again, and came out to give her some love too. ", "I looked everywhere to see if someone was missing a calico cat, she seemed too well behaved to be an alley cat, but at the same time showed signs of never being around humans much. I came up empty handed in my search. Andy told me that if she wants to stick around that we'd have to buy some cat food. I agreed and we went and bought her some food and her own dishes. ", "It took her a few months to come into our house on her own. The first night she slept in our room looked like it was the first night she was truly comfortable, and felt safe. She slept like pretzel with her belly facing out. It was a true sign of trust. ", "She quickly became used to the dogs even when they would get in her bubble. The friendly dog has come to befriend her, the guard dog has come to accept her, and the bratty dog has come to ignore her. ", "She has since been one of the best things to happen in our lives. She had one litter of kits before we could get he fixed, and we kept two of the four. All three of them are some of the smartest, sweetest, most loving cats I have come across. But then again, you could say I'm biased. ", "Sometimes my cat can't quit remember where he lives. I see him walking around the neighbourhood and he comes to say hello to me but he always looks lost. I think his sense of smell has gone and we live on a row of terrace houses which look pretty similar. I decided to fix this problem.", "Firstly i brought him back into the house and sat him down on the sofa. Well actually that was secondly. Firstly, I went down to B&Q and got a load of paint colour samples. Then with my cat sat on the sofa, I showed him the variety of colours. There was all sorts of greens and browns and yellows and blurples and turqurples, you name it.", "The little fella seemed to take a shine to one of the red colours, a very bright yet pale sort of red. One of my friends works at a paint factory, so i sent him the colour sample and he made me a big old batch. He never really asks for money, he just asks for favours or beers which is very handy, especially when I need paint.", "It was a nice sunny Wednesday, I had the day off work, the wife and kids were all out for the day and I had a load of red paint. I went out the front of the house, the cat was walking about and seemed partially relieved to see me. I looked up at the house and down to the cat and we gave each other a little nod. ", "I got the paint out, got the roller out and got out on the ladder. I have a little CD player that's been with me for ages and a CD of rock songs that my wife made for me on my 25th birthday. It was pretty nice hearing it again, I hadn't heard it in a while. It was a very long process of climbing up the ladder and painting so I decided to quicken the process. From the back garden I grabbed a couple of rakes and brooms and also some tape,nails and a hammer. The little guy seemed a little bit interested in what I was doing but his main concern was catching some z's on the front wall.", "With the cat napping and a bit of Hendrix playing, I fashioned a painting pole out of the broom and rake handles. This new, deluxe edition painting pole allowed to paint the heighty bits of the house eeeeeeeaassily. So that was how i spent my nice sunny Wednesday, painting my house red, with my cat relaxing and listening to a nostalgic CD on repeat.", "It was a very pleasant way to spend my day but don't think it really improved my cats memory. He still wanders around out the front, making friends with neighbours and passers by. Maybe he just likes wandering.", " was what I thought. ", " No, it's not the trigger assembly, no I didn't forget to turn off the safety. I'm a professional assassin, on a rooftop, with my target in sight. In less than a second, I would be done.", "Soon I began to shiver, I thought it would be like all other jobs. Get to a vantage point, aim, shoot, and get back inside someplace warm, but no. I was going to kill an innocent man. A man who did nothing wrong, had a loving wife and two kids, whom he loved just as much as his job. He was just a competitor to my boss was all.", "Five minutes in the cold and rain and I began shivering, my scope swaying more than it should. At least this cat that took a liking to me was warm in my jacket. ", "I said we. Slip of the tongue? Or did I mean me and this cat? I mean I could probably take him home, the vet bills wouldn't put a dent in my savings. I took a deep breath and steadied myself. But now my scope vibrated. The cat was purring, like it was content that it chose the right person to be his. If it even was a he. I guess this is affection. Haven't felt this in years...just. Cold.", "I know what I'm going to do, and I hope I've made the right choice. ", " went my safety. ", " Went the bolt action and bullet. ", " In to my case went the rifle, and an anonymous call to the man warned him that he was in danger. He deserves to at least know that people are targeting him, maybe even target his family.", "As for me, I went back home and gathered my essentials. Then I burnt the house down. And I ran. I found a place eventually, settled down, found Bullet here a playmate. That's what I named him. He has this copper tinge in his coat, and he always zipped around very quick. Just like a bullet. It's sunny here. The weather's always nice, the neighbors are nice, the scenery is nice. We're happy here.", "Hope you guys enjoyed this, I'm trying to get back into writing, so let me know if there is anything I could improve on!", "-", " ", "Feel free to replace the pronouns with your cats name, or lizards.", "It's been a long day, I was just in a bad mood. I just got to my apartment and opened the door. Just then my kitty strolled around the corner with a swagger in each step. He then started rubbing his head on my leg. It felt so warm. I totally forgot what was troubling. I stumbled to the couch and he jumped on my lap. He began to purr as I started petting his head. I turned on the tv and began to rewind with my kitty. My phone vibrates; I glance down and see it's from the business factory. I hit the end call button then go back to petting him. Suddenly, he jumps off my lap and runs off. I jump up and go after him. He went under my bed and I can see his eyes under there. \"Come here kitty\" I say. A few minutes pass and then he comes out with a small lizard in his mouth. He sets it on the ground and meows. I slowly lay the lizard on the palm of my hand. He looked healthy just wasn't really moving. I'm gonna name you \"(insert lizard name here.) that's a great name.\" I say to myself.", "I didn't have a lizard cage so I put him in an old coffee cup and get in my car to go get a cage and go to the vet. At the vet with my new lizard. I tell the staff about how my cat found him and they take him back. Soon then come out and tell me he was perfectly healthy. They hand me back and I pet his chin", "Sorry if my writing style is weird or bad I've never written narratively before ", "I commuted to college.  One day I tossed my backpack on an arm chair when I got home.  Then, to my ferrets' delight, it was playtime!  I released the ferrets from their cage and they promptly ran about the apartment getting into mischief and vocalizing their soft and happy \"dook.\" ", "Someone knocked. As I walked toward the door, all three ferrets appeared from their explorations, dancing under my feet.  I wrangled the squirmy ferrets into my arms and opened the door.", "Two Mormon missionaries stood in the entryway and asked if I knew about the Plan of Salvation. They noticed the ferrets doing their best to escape my hold.  The great outdoors is wonderful and unknown.  They must explore!  ", "My curiosity led me to invite them in.  I knew only the rumors of the LDS church and wanted  to find out what they really believed.  I released the three hooligans to the freedom of the apartment.  Of course, the missionaries became an target for natural curiosity.  ", "They sat on the couch across from me.  The ferrets explored their backpacks and tried to climb up their pant legs.  The missionaries were entertained and didn't mind the ferrets' antics. As we talked, the ferrets eventually lost interest and resumed their games. ", "Merlynn was a little albino female.  Her favorite activities were  climbing, exploring, and stealing items for her stash.  To her joy, she had the chance to do all three.  She climbed the arm chair where the backpack sat.  I ignored her.  It was a normal activity and I thought I had the \"forbidden\" pockets zipped.  She found a wonderful item.  It crinkled and was light and easy to carry away: which she did.  In the intensity only a ferret has, she ran across the room carrying away her prize.  One stash spot was  where the missionaries sat.  They attempted to ignore a ferret diving  under the couch carrying a sanitary pad.  Yet, their faces turned an amusing shade of red. I just shook my head and sighed.  That's just Merlynn the Ferret.", "The day dawned cold and sharp: although he woke pressed side-to-side with his brothers, he had smelt the cold with his first waking thought. The cold was new to him, a time when the air cut into his lungs and made everything difficult. The earth felt different during the cold and each breeze seemed to steal one's breath away. Tucked into the deep hollow of earth that was Home, days with cold were ones where discomfort warred with hunger. No one wanted to leave Home on those days, but the hunger pushed and pulled and someone would pull away from the others eventually, leaving an emptiness behind that the chill would use to creep in. After that there was no sense in any of them staying. ", "Despite the cold, he felt a sudden rush of delight as leaves crackled underfoot. Their movements, stirred as they were by his passage, seemed wonderfully unpredictable. With a breath and a wriggle he crushed one beneath his feet, then another, missing a third when one of his siblings reached it first. They struggled briefly over the honor, their small voices rising in challenge, until a moment of poor balance cost him the battle and he overturned. He lay in a tumble for a moment, catching his breath, until the sound of the leaves reminded him that there were leaves aplenty -- and, if they were lucky, their investigations would overturn something to eat as well. There was much to be found in the wood if you knew where to look and Mama always knew. ", "Today Mama was leading them somewhere new, a place so strange that they all lingered behind the trees before they approached it, even Mama. It was a mountain so high one could barely see the top, unnaturally smooth and angular. Light shone from it in patches: a captured star here, a dimmed star there, their purposes impossible to determine. There were large open spaces around the mountain and it was at the edge of one that they crouched. ", "Yet they knew why they were here, even with the uncomfortable strangeness of it, for mingled with the metallic and chemical odors of the place was a richer scent, hot and heady. There was meat here, fresh and not yet rotted, meat that had not been found by vultures or coyotes. Those creatures would not dare come here, where their larger bodies would be easily spotted. ", "Mama went first, creeping cautiously along, her body low to the ground and her head held up. One by one the others followed. The tall grasses hid them without the need to crouch as Mama had done, and although they did their best they blundered into one another and over rocks and sticks. The smell grew stronger as they crept along and they had almost reached it when disaster struck. Perhaps it was the noise they made, young as they were and not so graceful as Mama; perhaps it was by some other sign that their downfall came. ", "There was a noise, loud and horrible, a creeping, creaking sound followed by a bang like the sound a tree made when it hit the ground. They ran in half a dozen directions, some back to the wood, some forward, one or two to either side. He heard a deep and terrible sound, something in between a coyote's bark and an owl's sonorous call, and fled without marking the direction. Through the grass he glimpsed a creature a hundred times his size, huge and terrible, with great sagging folds of skin hanging from its skeletal body. He did not know where Mama was, where his brothers or sisters were, where anything was. He fled until there was no more noise, until he could wedge himself into a tiny space that held no more horror. ", "The crevice he had found smelled strongly of something he could not place, but that was all to the good. Even if the monster had a nose like a coyote, it would not find him here. His heart pounded madly in his chest, and he shook with fear, for if a coyote could not find him .. what if Mama couldn't either? Yet before he could work up the courage to slip out of his hiding place, the monster drew nearer, its massive feet marking its location with thunderous footsteps. He held his breath, closing his eyes  and biting back a whine of terror as the creature approached. ", "It grew closer .. closer .. and then clambered atop the mountain in which he was hidden, making the whole of it shudder and shake with its great weight. Did it know he was here? Did it realize that its prey huddled inside the mountain? He didn't know but he couldn't run out now, for it would surely see him. There was a jolt and the mountain began to shake anew, vibrating under his feet, and his stomach lurched. Fear alone kept him in place, huddled in a tight ball of misery. ", "Hours passed -- or minutes -- he wasn't sure how long he was wedged there in that awful place, a strange heat building around him. He knew only that after a time, the unaccountable vibration seemed to push him forward; startled from his reverie, he clung and scrabbled at the interior of his prison, but it was no use. Bit by bit he slid, slipping toward the entrance that had led to this small space. Although his hiding place had grown warm, cold air rushed past him as he fell, and he tumbled and bumped and rolled, then hit the hard ground with a sudden pang of agony as the mountain rushed over him. All at once he was in the open air, flung there by some great force, and the terrifying emptiness of the sky above him was almost worse than the pain. ", "One leg burned with pain, new and unaccountable: he had never felt anything like this in his short life. There were a dozen other small aches, but those were easier to ignore than his leg. He tried to stand, the openness of the world screaming to him of danger, but his leg gave way beneath him. Fear choking him, he set himself to crawling, praying that he would come to some shelter -- darkness, if not warmth or care. There was a roaring nearby, too massive to be an animal, but he could not bring himself to look. He bent all his energy on crawling, pushing himself forward inch by inch .. ", "... until something lifted him from the cold ground. He cried out, certain at first that some even more horrible fate awaited him, but fear and weariness soon spirited away his voice. Soft warmth enclosed him and at first he fought, but it wrapped more tightly around his body and he had not the strength to escape. He lay still, panting with exhaustion and pain, and after a time he slept. ", "When he woke again, the pain in his leg had dulled to a distant ache. Mama was cleaning him, working at some stubborn spot on his forehead again and again, and he began to squirm before he even opened his eyes. When he did he went still, for it was not Mama but one of the giant creatures: so much larger that even its head was many times his size. He froze, wide-eyed, but it made small noises and began to clean him again. The touch was so like Mama's, the gesture so familiar, that he found himself relaxing. When the cleaning was done it set before him a mound of something that smelled absolutely heavenly and he set himself to it with a will, standing up to make certain he could reach every morsel of the magnificent feast. Behind him the giant made strange sounds, the purpose of which he could not understand, but the food was not taken away so he ignored them. ", "Only once he had nearly eaten his fill did he realize that he was not alone. A short distance away sat someone even bigger than Mama, whose larger frame had been the biggest he had ever known. He was male and darker than she was, a looming wall of midnight black. Realizing with a start that this must be his territory, that he had all unknowingly intruded, he stopped eating, mouth going dry. ", "But the hulking figure did not growl or curse: he merely settled into a seated position, feet tucked beneath him and expression indicating mild interest. ", "Well. ", "That was not what he expected. Food momentarily forgotten, he approached: cautious at first and then delighted, relieved that he was not alone with these terrifying giants after all. ", "In later days, he learned that the giants had a name for him, a certain collection of syllables. Answering to those sounds often resulted in pleasant caresses or edible delicacies. The agonizing pain in his leg retreated, becoming nothing but a distant memory, and there were no more days of cold, sharp and painful. There was food, as much as he could wish, and when the giants were still for any length of time he could stretch himself atop them and forget that there ever had been cold at all. His new brother often cleaned him, as Mama had once done, and was there to sleep beside whenever he was lonely. ", "He could not completely forget the events that had brought him here, and there were times when loud noises drove him into hiding, reluctant to emerge for hours at a time, but he could not discount the profound changes that had been wrought in his life due to those brief hours of terror and pain. He had a Home now, where he was warm and fed and kept in the pleasant company of others of his kind. ", "Best of all, at times the giants brought others into the Home, small and wriggling and crying with loneliness or loss, and just as his new elder brother had once done for him he was there to comfort them. To clean their heads and sleep beside them so that they would know that whatever had passed before this moment, they were now warm and safe.", "[[ Sorry, couldn't manage to work in a lizard, but here's a story with a kitten and a happy end! :) I thought it would be fun to do a dramatic take on the story of how we got one of our cats!

However, he tumbled into our lives just months after we had attempted to rescue another cat, a big ginger tom that sadly passed away before we could get him the care he deserved. When we'd wiped away the grease and found Harold shared his markings and his colors, we knew we couldn't give him away. ", " ]]", "The kid looked intently at his pets. They looked back at him.

Ohshitohshitohshit.\" said the lizard.", "\"He's bluffing.\" assured the cat. \"Baby monitors don't record videos. They just stream the feed. He's trying to coerce into confessing.\" said the cat.", "\"You speak now. Or I'll show this video to my parents. I swear I will upload it on youtube.\" threatened the kid.", "\"Oh man. That doesn't sound like bluffing.\" said the lizard. The cat stares at the kid for a good read on his face. \"Yep, he's bluffing. Stand your ground.\" said the cat. \"I say we just kill him and get out of the house.\" suggested the lizard. The cat broke eye contact for the first time and looked at the lizard, considering it or simply appalled by the suggestion. It forced the lizard to look at the cat too.", "A dog out of nowhere jumped at the kid playfully and made the baby monitor fly out of his hand and out of the window.", "\"NO!\" screamed the kid. He ran to the window to check what happened to it. \"No,  Danny you idiot!\" said the kid to his bulldog, before he paused and eyed him with suspicious as it put his tongue out all happy as if expecting a reward.", "\"Great, he's into me too now.

The reptile looked at him, and the knight looked back at him. The \"dragon\" then noticed the sword in the tabby's mouth. It gave Alex puppy eyes, and Alex immediately dropped his sword. The lizard was too cute, how could he possibly harm it? Let alone kill it. The green-eyed cat then found a stick on the ground. \"Fetch!\" He called, throwing the stick into the distance.", "The bearded dragon ran away, only to come back with the stick in his mouth.

Her face dissipated all the thoughts in my busy mind. I remember the day she was born, everything else in this world became insignificant to me in her presence. She was, is and will always be the one thing that makes sense of my existence. I look at my little girl's face, her face brings me to a smile.

Mits was huddled in an impossibly little ball on David's lap, savoring the sweet warmth, and lightly flicking its tail every now and then. David couldn't help but smile. Mits had become quite a big cat since he and Josephine adopted her a few years ago, yet at times like this she would still seem a kitten, their little Mits.

She saw them, and her lips turned into a sleepy smile while she stretched. David went still for a second, and appreciated her beauty.

She walked towards them, with slow, graceful strides, accentuated, instead of faulted, by her grogginess, and careful sat on her heels, facing him. \"Hi\", she whispered, smiling. Her eyes were honey, and turned to gold as the sun illuminated them under her long lashes. Some of her hair had matted on the side of her face, reaching all the way down to the side of her full lips, slightly cracked from the coldness of the season.

I'm just a rare breed.\"", "The girl had never heard of a winged breed of cat, but she held her tongue because she knew that it would be rude to pry.", "\"Now then,\" the cat replied, \"There was something shiny in this knot up near the trunk and I stuck my paw inside, but now I can't get it out.  Might you be able to help me get free?\"", "The girl looked up at the tree.  It didn't look very easy to climb, but there was a tree next to it that seemed a bit easier to scale.

It was nap-time - as it often was - and I was lounging on the throne my servants had fetched for me after I had become bored with the last one they had acquired.

At first I believed it to be a replacement for abominable accommodations they called a restroom that had been provided to me when I took up residence. But if it were to act as my new facilities, they had not put sufficient thought into it. Convenience is king, and I saw no simplicity in leaping in and out of my commode. ", "I became further perplexed when they began filling my new restroom with water from a long green hose protruding from the window. I had little time to think of it however, as a beautiful winged beast flitted about just outside my domain. The vibrant colors captivated me so. I knew then that I must destroy it, but that is a tale for another time. There are more important things at hand and you have distracted me from the point for far too long! Why were my servants filling my new facilities with water? Did they not know of my loathing? Did they both fall on their heads and incur simultaneous concussions? Surely, this is the only explanation for such a blunder!", "As I crept forward to punish my restroom attendant, my chef lifted the most gorgeous creature I have ever seen out of a strange white box. She kept the creature in an austere transparent bubble. Surely, she did not mean for me to eat this magnificent beauty? Give me a tuna and I shall devour it whole in a night, but I would sooner starve than destroy such majesty. She was the color of royalty with thick dark lines that bolted from her beautiful black eyes all the way to her exquisite yellow tail. Though she lacked my paws, she moved with feline grace in her prison. I had never known my kind to dwell in the water, but who am I to judge?", "At last, they released my paramour into the crystal box. Ever so slowly, they placed tributes into the waters and transformed her new home from a barren wasteland to a palace! Chests of treasures beyond measure, rare plants that I had never before seen, and a hand-crafted castle for her to retire to for her most assuredly frequent naps adorned the vessel. What I thought was grace in her previous quarters was mere stumbling. She took to her new waters swimmingly, if you\u2019ll pardon my word choice \u2013 which you will of course.

I followed her route, albeit much less effortless, and eventually I found myself nearer to her, after much almost failed jumps. I don't understand why humans believe we always land on our feet.

Although he loved his new life as a house cat he enjoyed a bit of adventure.", "The yard beyond the pool was a sloping green lawn ending with a creek drifting through a small forest. On either side of his home were other houses. His fellow cats lived in houses beyond those. From the trees came a soft meow followed by two thumps.

Mr. Whiskers stared into the distance, \"I assembled you all here today for a new challenge.\" Fluffy and Marbles glanced at each other. \"The formidable Lizard Alliance has reorganized since the last attack.\" The lizard alliance consisted of the Anole lizards of Florida that liked to invade houses during the day to party and trash the place while owners were gone.

Let's pick up where we left off and protect our owner's homes!\" ", "A loud meow boomed through the woods and Pancakes, a large British shorthair waddled towards them. He came to a stop behind Marbles and Fluffy. He meowed, \"Lizards approaching from the north!\" Mr. Whiskers was unsurprised \"excellent!\" The four turned to see the approaching lizards. There were around four hundred of them. The Lizard Alliance had been partying all night in the woods and were looking for a nice house full of food and drinks to steal. The lizards chanted songs of battle as they approached. They were ready for another fight with these annoying house cats.", "Mr. Whiskers launched into the air. He turned his head side to side shooting sharp whiskers from his cheeks. The whiskers scattered the lizards, but they repositioned themselves in three groups and began throwing rocks at the cats. \"Go!\" Mr. Whiskers cried as Fluffy and Marbles charged. Marbles spit marbles from his mouth while Fluffy used her soft furry tail to block the rocks thrown by the lizards. A stray rock hit Fluffy on her shoulder and Mr. Whiskers shouted \"regroup!\" ", "The lizards began advancing slowly puffing up their necks in a display of color to ward off predators. They took bark off of trees to use as shields to block the marbles. Mr. Whiskers, Fluffy and Marbles moved behind Pancakes. Mr. Whiskers quietly said \"steady. Launch!\" And Pancakes sat on his hind legs with his front legs up and began shooting pancakes out of his front paws. A rapid fire of steaming pancakes flattened one group of lizards leaving two more groups. ", "\"Flying Sabortooth attack go!\" Mr. Whiskers shouted the code name. Pancakes rolled over to lay on his back and Fluffy, Marbles and Mr. Whiskers used Pancake's belly to bounce into the air. Marbles and Mr. Whiskers shot marbles and sharp whiskers as the lizards tried to regroup around mounds of pancakes. Fluffy rolled into a ball as she neared the ground and crashed through any lizards still standing. Lizards flew through the air, ate steaming piles of pancakes or ran off. ", "\"Victory!\" Pancakes meowed as he rolled over and sat up, grabbing himself a pancake to munch on. \"Whoo hoo!\" Marbles exclaimed. Fluffy brushed lizards out of her fur and purred. \"Good job team\", Mr. Whiskers said. His ears perked up, \"the owners have returned!\" Pancakes shoved the rest of the pancake in his mouth and mumbled, \"See you tomorrow!\" Marbles yelled, \"catch ya later!\" Fluffy meowed.", "Mr. Whiskers returned through the hole in the screen as his owner came out the back door. His owner asked, \"What have you been up to Mr. Whiskers?\" He only purred in response.", "\"Ah. Yes, I'll see what I can do about it.\"\nI quickly rush over to my manager and he can see my confused expression. \n\"What's the matter Justin? You need something?\" he asks. \n\"Yes... it appears that the customer over there has made a special request on top of his order\" I reply. He nods at me to go on. \"Well, he ordered our special grilled sashimi selection and a regular chicken karaage don (ricebowl), but asked if it was possible, to add to the order 'Something happy, with cats, and maybe lizards.' Do we have anything for him Boss? ", "My manager is evidently surprised as well. His face shifted from a perplexed expression to one of mischief and cunning. \"Yes, I'll be sure to facilitate our guest's order.\" And with that, he ran off to the kitchen. \nI continue to serve the customers and when his order was complete, I brought the man's order to him. He gives me a quizzical look and asks \"That's it? Just a regular order?\"", "\"Sir, I can assure you, something special is coming along with this. In the meantime, please enjoy your meal\" I reply. I head towards the kitchen, and lo and  behold, the manager has created a monstrosity. \nIt turns out, my boss told the chefs to prepare hot skewers, then ran into the alleyway and found a stray cat. He lured it over with leftover fish and caught it in a net. Now, he was tying the cat's legs together and drawing a large smile on the cat's face, as he grilled it alive. The foul stench of burnt fur could be smelled faintly through our kitchen's powerful ventilation system. But alas, it seems that he ordered for geckos as well, and the delivery man arrives and takes payment for the four geckos he brings. He takes the hot skewers and pierces the geckos onto the poor cat, two as substitute ears and the last two as a lengthened tail. A gasp of horror escapes my mouth and he somehow hears it and turns and smiles at me. ", "\"Isn't this wonderful Justin?\" he asks. \"I think our guest will be presently surprised!\" \n\"Ah, yes... I think he will be!\" I reply nervously. I think to myself, \"Hell no, you're a monster dude. Get me outta here.\" I decide, I do not want to be the one presenting this, so my next sentence was a pure work of a genius.\n\"Boss, since you uh, worked so hard on this, why don't you present this to him?\" I say.\n\"Absolutely\" he replies. At this point, I loosen my waiter's uniform. I already received my paycheck yesterday, so I could afford to miss out on today's action. My boss finishes grilling the poor cat and adds the finishing touches before taking it out. I slip out to refill waters here and there, keeping an eye out for when my boss makes his appearance.", "I hear the doors creak as they open and close. Behold, my boss has come out, covering the special dish with a large metal cover. He brings it to the guest, who finishes his last piece of grilled sashimi. \n\"Is this the surprise?\" the guest asks.\n\"Indeed, my apologies for the wait.\" He lifts the cover. \"I present to you, a special dish. Here, we have a most delicate grilled cat, with happy additions of a smile and enlarged ears and a lengthened tail made from a most delicate lizard. Enjoy this master piece!\"", "The guest has a look of horror on his face and is clearly appalled. He responds \"What the hell is this? When I asked for something happy with cats and maybe lizards, I meant maybe shape the sashimi and rice after cats and lizards, and maybe put a cheap smile on them. How did it turn into this? How the hell is anyone supposed to eat it? Is it even clean? This cat just looks like my cat that went missing recently, and these lizards look like my geckos from the pet store. Oh no... it is you... my poor cat... oh Muffins, what has he done to you?!\" ", "At this point, reality stopped making sense. This man begins to eat his own grilled cat, only to be disgusted by the taste and the unclean state of his cat. He chokes and throws up. My boss has a horrified look on his face. Other customers ser and begin screaming at the horrific monstrosity that has been created. I slip off my uniform and run out the front door. I'm not sticking around to see what happens. So I end up going home and drinking some wine to help cope with the reality I witnessed that day.", "A few days later, the restaurant is now closed and the boss has since then been arrested for animal cruelty and improper conduct.

Sir Winston Churchill managed to negotiate our release with their leadership, only to be interrupted by a shirtless Jack devouring Doritos and riffing on an air guitar.

The core hummed loudly as we snuck along, our hearts pounding, expecting our captors to jump out at any second. We reached a pod and opened the door. Jack leapt out of the escape pod, Doritos in hand. He climbed on top of the power core like it was a box amp and started a particularly wild air guitar routine, ignoring the many animated warning signs about keeping the area clean. As Dorito crumbs fell into the power core like a gentle orange snowfall, it began to glow brightly and shake. We clambered into the escape pod, and before I shut the door I turned around and saluted. Jack stopped, saluted back with a cocky half-grin, and resumed his wild pantomiming as the exploding core enveloped him, and we shot into the expanse of space, finally, returning home.", "\"Rockin' balls, whoa!\"", "Had I been here days?

Staring back at me was none other than...", "\"Jack Black?\" I asked in disbelief. The plump actor came into focus three feet beyond the bars of my cell. He was sitting cross-legged, casually clad in jean shorts and black tee shirt. His ragged hair hung down in greasy clumps around his shoulders.

I was then treated to a panoramic view of his bulk as he reared back from the slab to unleash a gigantic belly laugh!  Then, just as suddenly, he surged forward and slammed me right in the forehead with a savage head-butt!  ", "\"", "\" I thought, as consciousness faded from my body.", "I awoke in a hospital bed, drenched in sweat, my head killing me.  I saw next to my bed the backs of two concerned orderlies monitoring my vitals on nearby equipment.  I pieced together my situation and decided I must have been in some kind of car accident, and my sweating body and head injury must have made their way into my dream.  Thank God it was finally over, now maybe I can recover.", "One of the orderlies turned to me and noticed I was awake.  What happened next turned my sweat cold.

The first is that this must be purgatory.  The second was that I didn't like the direction my afterlife was going.", "\"SKIBBITY HIBBITY HOOOAHHHH HIYYYYYYYYAH!!!!\"  ", "Jack handed him the slop.", "\"Dude, you're gonna get out of here, I promise you, trust me.\" Immediately followed by whispering \"I'm on your side XD.\" Jack consoles the prisoner.

", "Something something, jack shoots all the aliens with lightning from a sick futuristic guitar and their innards explode all over everyone's face the end.", "I awoke to a blinding light and my head was pounding. I reached over to my bed stand for the remote to my blinds and my hand brushed up against something metallic and cold. My eyes had started to adjust and I realized I was in some sort of lab, instead of my bed where I had went to sleep the night before. On the metal tray where my hand were several metallic objects I had never seen before, nor did they resemble anything I have ever seen.", "\"Yo\" a voice over to the side of the room startled me and I flipped of the examination table and sprawled out onto the floor.", "\"Dude that looked painful, you alright?\" Said them man coming over to offer me a hand. He was pretty short with thick wavy hair and he looked a bit on the large size, he was wearing basic jeans and a T-shirt that had pink floids album art on it.", "\"Where am I!?\" I stammered, just now realized I was wearing what looked like a hospital gown. \"Who are you?\"", "\"Uhhhh, jack black. You know, high fidelity? School of rock, tenacious D, King Kong?\" I just stared at him in disbelief, it really was him, what the hell. \"As to where we are, we are in a mutherfuckin space ship. Yeah, that's right, an alien space ship.\" He said twirling his fingers around his head, as to make what he said sound even crazier.", "\"Well how do we leave?\" I ask, I never really was one for conversation, short and simple and to the point.", "\"Leave?\" He replied. \"Why would anyone want to leave? You get to do whatever you want here! The little dudes, they are AWESOME! Look at this even.\" He picks up a bag of something and starts popping the contents into his mouth. \"These are phleebos, basically cheetos but the space kind. They are fuckin Suh-weet. You gotta try some.\" He holds out a handful of what looks similar to cicada shells covered in a white powder. No thanks.", "I frantically start pacing around the room, looking for a way out. Why aren't there any doors in this room?! \"Jack how did you get in this room with me?\"", "\"Oh, you just walk through the door, you see that wall there that's red instead of white, that's the door, just walk into it.\" He said jamming more phleebos into his mouth.", "I looked at the wall and couldn't wait any longer, I ran full speed into the red wall, I had to get out of here as fast as possible. I had hoped to be ported to like a dick or something, or to someone I could talk to, or to anywhere really. I had really hoped it would be somewhere, instead of just crashing into it like a fly stuck in a jar. My body crashed against the wall with a huge thud.", "\"Hahaha\" Jack burst out laughing. \"You need to turn it on.\" Jack walked over to the wall and started furrowing his brow and looking intensely at the wall, like he was trying to communicate with it. His face got really intense like he was hyper focusing or trying to bend it with his mind. Then out of nowhere he let out a long and loud fart and started laughing. He reached his hound out and touched the wall and all of a sudden the entire wall sprung to life, like it was covered in millions and millions or red ants crawling all over each other. \"After you\" he said.", "I got up of the floor and stared at the wall. This didn't look safe at all. This time I slowly made my way to the wall and reluctantly placed my hand against its ever shifting surface. It passed through with ease, but it really did feel like a ring of ands was crawling on my forearm where my hand currently was through the portal. I helps my breath and walk through the remainder just to greeted on the other side my jack black again, how did he get infront of me?", "\"Your free to go truekeitaro, as long as you can make it through the trial.\" He said, without looking at me, his gaze was focused around the corner, I could see lights reflecting of his eyes.", "\"Don't you want to leave too jack?\" I asked, not really caring if he came back with me or not.", "\"Nah\" he quickly said. \" Me and the little dudes got a pretty fucking awesome band thing going on. We are called, 'The pooskidoos' they have no clue what that means... but still, our music, is out of this world! LITERALLY!\"", "With that I just walked by him, to see what my trial was. I came into a room, with a television, and an bowl of phleebos and a chair. I saw a door on the other side of the room, it's locked.  So reluctantly I sat in the chair facing the screen. As I sat down the movie big daddy started playing on the screen. I looked around to see if anyone was around, no-one. I guess I just have to watch the movie...", "I sat through the whole movie, and as soon as the credits started I heard a click from the door. I slowly approached it and cracked the door open, it led into an identicle room just like the one I was in.", "\"I wouldn't go any further if I was you.\" Jack said close to my ear, that bastard snuck up behind me. \" Once you start the next part of the trial, you can't come back.\"", "\"What's the next part of the trial?\"", "\"Can't say\" he says with a serious look on his face. \"But you could just stay here, things are pretty awesome, and you haven't even seen the holo deck yet!\"", "I look at him in disbelief before walking through the door and cordially slamming it in his face. Good riddance, I didn't even like that guy's movies. I walked over to the chair and took a seat. There was another locked door in the back of this room. As soon as I sat down the movie click started playing. ", "\"Oh lords another Adam Sandler movie!? Come one really!\" I yell out loud, to no one in particular. I sit through the whole movie, grinding my teeth, just waiting for it to be over, as soon as the credits roll the door unlocks. I sprint to it just to find myself in another room just like the last two.

Deeds.\n...", "I looked incredulously at Jack Black, trying to discern what the hell was happening.  He just chomped on the potato chips, glared back, and smiled.  The look of puzzlement on my face prompted him to finally speak.  I lay chained to the bed in irons.", "\"You know who I am?\"", "\"Uhh..  yeah.  You're Jack Black.  I've seen nearly all your movies.\"", "\nJack's eyes widened, and a smiled appeared on his face.\n\"\nSo you're a fan!\"  Which one is your favourite?\"", "\"Jack...  I've seen nearly all your movies.  Including Nacho Libre.  I wouldn't say I was a fan.  That movie...\"  I trailed off without words to describe it.", "Jacks left his face, and was replaced by a look of anger and hurt.\n\"Fuck..  I travel 5 trillion miles away from earth, and there's always a critic!  That movie was huge!  It made big money!  Maybe it wasn't the greatest of movies...  but...  Wait a minute...  you've seen nearly all my movies, but you're not a fan.  WTF lady?\"", "\"My roommate smokes a lot of pot, and owns the TV in the house.\"", "\"ohh...  right.  My biggest demographic.\"", "\"Well did you like ANYTHING I was in?\"", "\"Jack...  we're trapped on a Alien spacecraft, headed for god knows where.  Millions of miles\"", "Jack interrupted me \"Trillions\".", "My tension increased  \"What?\"", "\"No, it's trillions..  Millions would be like nothing...  We'd still be barely away from earth at that distance\".", "\"Whatever!  The point is I'm trapped on a spacecraft, abducted by bug eyed monsters and you're worried about your ego!\".", "Jack did his best impression of Steve Martin  \"Well excuuuuse me!\"", "\"Come on..  you had to like something!\"", "\"Well...  I thought High Fidelity was pretty good.  Also School of Rock.  But what the hell, why am I here?  What's going on?\"", "\"Oh they didn't tell you?\"", "\"Tell me what?\"", "\"About the movie.\"", "\"Movie, what movie?\"", "\"The movie we're going to make.  Shit..  sorry, they told me they'd tell you!  That's why we...  err they abducted you...  well..  us for that matter.\"", "I turned my head to my chains, and looked up at him still lazily crunching on potato chips.", "\"You don't look very abducted\".", "\"Well I'm a star!  You have to expect a little better treatment from people....  Besides, these aliens LOVE all my movies.  All of them!  In fact, that's why we were both abducted.  They want to make a sequel\".", "\"Oh god...  not of Nacho Libre.   I heard you wanted to a sequel of that piece of shit\".", "\"uhh...  no.\"", "\"Well what then?\".", "\"You're not going to like it\".", "\"Tell me!\"", "\"You've seen all my movies?\"", "\"Every one, unfortunately\".", "\"Well...  you're REALLY not going to like it\".", "\"Which one!?\"", "\"Year one\".", "\"What!?\"", "\"That was bad...  even for you!\"  ", "\"Yeah, I know...  that one I can't defend.  Poor Harold Ramis...  of all the movies to be his last one.  But this alien commander love it for some goddamned crazy reason.  On his planet I think he's sort of the alien equivalent of Kin Jung Il, of North Korea who kidnap people from South Korea, and force them to make movies.\"", "I awake dizzy, my first sensation is how wet I am. Covered in alien slime.  I wipe the slag from my eyes and look around the fleshy confines of the ship, \"I must have been abducted\" I think to myself. I still have my Sheriff's uniform and belt, my gun, thank God.  A door opens like a prolapsed anus pulling back into itself and Jack Black appears from the shadow of the doorway.  I fire my gun, BANG, square in his chest. Like a wet turd into dry sand, he hits the floor. As I walk by him threw the door, he looks, he says, \"I'm not an alien, I'm ja..\" \"Jack Black, I know, I've seen your movies.\" I interrupt. I knew it was my last bullet, but as I make my way down the next hall I can't help but think, \"worth it.\"", "I was sore from the probing, my mind weak from endless hours of testing, but nothing could have prepared me for the company of Jack Black. Trapped together in a bright white cell, his presence onboard the alien spacecraft was more torture than I could ever have previously imagined. Worse still, there was no reason for his existence, except seemingly to torture me further. He sat slumped in a chair, leering at me through greasy black locks, smirking while I desperately felt the walls for fractures. His faded plaid shirt left open, revealing a tired, hair-covered gut which was peppered with crumbs. Now and then, I would flinch in pain from where the aliens had examined me, and he would snort and cough on leftover, half-chewed crisps. I wished he would choke to death. ", "A hole suddenly opened in the wall and one of them glided in. Jack suddenly sat bolt upright, like an obedient mutt, eyes steadily following the alien as it made its way towards him. It was then that I knew. A deafening sound screeched and I clasped my hands over my ears, watching through tear-filled eyes as Jack Black's skin retreated from his skull down to his feet, revealing a hideous creature so repulsive that I began to vomit. He was one of them. The alien slowly crept onto him, merging their bodies into one. I knew that I had to kill it, even if it meant killing myself in the process. I leapt at the beast, digging my nails into what I thought were eye sockets, and did my best to drill my hands into its brain. Suddenly I felt as though I was being sucked in. My hands fell forward and I grasped at nothingness until I could see nothing but darkness. It had consumed me. ", "I lay there in the dim, flickering light of my cell fighting off sleep as the dull drone of unknown machinery hummed away somewhere on the other side of my cell wall. It had been days since I had arrived, perhaps longer, and still I had no real idea why I had been abducted. Only the ravings of what I now assumed to be a lunatic.", "The creatures themselves didn't seem hostile in any way. Small and brownish green with large eyes and small, twitching antennae they looked to be somewhere between a bug and a man. I had been asleep when they brought me aboard and thus had no real idea how I had gotten there, only knowing that I woke up in sheer terror as I found myself looking up at the odd extraterrestrials. My first instinct had been to run. Where to I had no idea, only that I needed to escape. To flee for my life. That is when it happened.", "I had been so pre-occupied with looking over my shoulder and trying to ensure I hadn't been followed that I failed to notice the short, chubby leg that extended its' way around a corner and into my path. As soon as my foot made contact with it I was sent flying head over heels onto the cold, metal floor.", "\"Hey!\" Shouted an oddly familiar voice from above me, \"Little alien dudes! He's over here!\" I managed to roll over and gaze up at the one who had put such a quick stop to my escape. Much to my shock I found myself gazing at none other than Jack Black, a family sized bag of Lay's potato chips in one arm whilst the other hurriedly shoved more of the grease soaked plant matter into his mouth, leaving crumbs and grease flecks across his face.", "\"H...how?\" Was all I had time to ask before two of my minuscule captors arrived and injected something into my neck. The last thing I remembered seeing before darkness overtook me was Jack's crumb covered face looking down at me. I awoke some time later within my cell, Jack sitting outside with another bag of chips (now it was a family sized container of cool ranch doritoes) at what appeared to be some sort of desk. \"Where am I?\" I inquired groggily, trying to stand and being forced to lean against the wall for support.", "\"Uhhh.... SPACE. DUH.\" Mr. Black replied as he shoved 2000 calories into his mouth and began to chew noisily. ", "\"Ok...\" I replied, getting somewhat irritated with his flippant tone, \"WHY am I in space?\" Jack seemed to ignore me this time, instead turning his attention to some sort of magazine on the desk in front of him.", "\"Dudesky...\" He said at last, chuckling a bit as he lifted the magazine to show me, \"Space porn is nuts!\" As he spoke he turned to a random page, pointing at what might have either been some sort of organ or a split open grapefruit. \"What the fuck is that?!?!\"", "\"What the fuck are you talking about?!?\" I exclaimed, becoming more and more irate, \"Why am I in a cell? Why do these aliens want me? AND WHERE DO YOU KEEP GETTING THOSE FUCKING CHIPS?!?!\" ", "\"Bro... chill out!\" Jack replied, seeming to take me seriously for just a moment, \"The little ET dudes just wanna probe you a little and then we can go.\" ", "\"WHAT?\" I cried, grabbing the bars, \"Fuck that! Let me outta here!\" Jack shook his head and took another quick bite of chips.", "\"Noooooooo way man. If you get away then they're gonna probe me. I have a tender ass. It would kill me.\"", "\"And you think I want to get probed?!?!\" I replied, practically yelling now. \"If they already had you why do they need me?\"", "Jack shrugged and stood up, walking off towards the nearby door. \"I told them I was allergic to probes. Speaking of which you probably wanna try and relax a little man. That thing is like 3 feet across. It's nuts!\" He turned at last and began to go out the door.", "\"WAIT!\" I screamed, \"Where are you going?!?\"", "\"To get some chips Dude-areno!\" He yelled back as the door shut.", "?? - \"Where the fuc... am I...\"", "?? - \"HAHAHA, there goes another idiot trying the 'my cell mate is having a seizure, help him please' strategy.

They eat, they drink, they pleasure themselves or each other with their disgusting, sloppy mouths. They intake the poison, again and again until it kills them. Humans were never meant for such perversion. We can live forever, so long as we refuse the temptations of the beast.\"", "\"The poison. It's in everything. If anything touches your tongue, you have been exposed to it, and it takes it's hold. At first it's diluted. They get it only in tiny increments. Then the addiction sets in, and they're tied to it. They have to drink or they lose their minds. They'll scream for it! Endlessly, screaming! Then, it's not long until they start drinking the poison straight. Look at the masses! They do it hundreds of times a day, constantly swigging away at bottles, canteens, cups, and glasses, moving faster and faster toward their own death! They start consuming it in all forms. They become lost to the addiction. At that point, there's nothing that can be done. If they stop, the withdrawal effects of the poison will surely kill them, even sooner than it would otherwise. Hope is lost. They're locked into their own impending doom.\"", "\"A cure? Sure, it can be avoided. Look at me! I'm nine-hundred years old. The temptation to drink doesn't even reach me anymore. If I die, it will be alongside the rest of humanity. Until then, I will continue on. Even as entire generations drop dead around me.\"", "\"For you? No, my friend. I'm afraid there's no hope. You can blame your caregiver for that. They committed you to the poison before you could even lift your own head up. You were completely subject to their will, a clueless infant, unable to act on your own, and now, their ignorance has determined your fate. Look at you. Your smooth skin, your plump features...God I mourn for you, friend. You wear the face of human depravity.\"", "\"Dude you've got to meet this guy. He looks so... different but speaks so wise. Have you seen \"The Man from Earth\" where the guy is immortal, it's almost like he is that guy.\" said John to Misty, switching on the air conditioner and standing in front of it.", "\"What's his secret? LSD?\" said Misty slyly almost mocking. She removed her clothes and started fanning herself with it.", "\"Well I don't know, his face is almost like contours in a mountain and his voice crackles when he speaks, but if you hear it, wisdom falls like waterfall\" said John, finally sitting down with relief. He picks up a newspaper and an article reads \"Finally proven 100% of people who drink water will die.\" He chuckles. ", "\"Well, let's go have a look at this contour man you talk about in the afternoon during lunch break tomorrow. Does his room has AC?\" ", "I live in a small room, with no distraction. It's an empty room. The only item that I carry is my mind. ", "They come to the room, having taken an appointment. These types of meetings are my only source of income. They look puzzled and distracted upon seeing my room, nothing new. I look at her bag's side pocket to see if she brought a water bottle. She did, but it was empty.  ", "\"Before you ask, my room is empty because there is no need for material things to surround me with as I surround myself with the genius inside me. With silence. A silence that speaks volumes of knowledge, wisdom and wit. I don't go out because there is nothing that your world can teach me as it is rotten now. I look weak but I can kill you in 3 seconds barely so don't try. And no I won't tell you the secret to my immortality.\"", "John and Misty were shocked. They collect themselves and Misty seemed visibly irritated. She nudges to John to say what she had in mind.", "\"Sir, its blaring hot outside. Can we have some water?\" ", "I faint.", "Disclaimer - first time here, but this is the first prompt I've seen that I think I can come up with something for. I am a terrible writer and did a few odd things in high school, but I'd like to give it another go. I tried to write a little differently than I normally did.", "The bright light burns my eyes. I feel cold and numb. I try to move but my body is not responding. I am not breathing on my own. All I want to do is writhe in pain but I cannot. I am wrapped in blankets that feel heavier than myself but I have never felt so exposed. I try to look and see where I am and what is happening, but my eyes are soon forced shut. I've never felt pain like this before. In momentary glimpses I can see that the lights are moving, coming into focus as they pass from the top of my vision to the bottom. There are bumps - I can feel my body being disturbed in regular intervals. The cushion that I am laying on is hard. I can feel it through the blankets. Each bump sends a shiver through my spine, it is uncomfortable but not painful. And in each bump I can hear a noise like paper. I feel a stinging sensation on my arm. I black out.", "I awake to a melody. I've heard it before. It's a calming tune. It makes me feel safe. There is a high pitched noise coming from my left. It is loud and thumping. The sound is turbulent but regular. I again try to open my eyes but I am unable to keep them open. I make out more lights, but they are not moving this time. I try to let out a cry, or any noise to let someone know that I am awake, but nothing happens. I hear another noise, it is tapping. This time the sound is rhythmic and growing louder. I try to brace myself. The blankets are removed and the coldness is gone. I still feel mostly numb and helpless. My right arm is raised up and I can feel prodding fingers work their way from the palm of my hand up to my shoulder. The fingers are soft and pleasant, but the way they are doing their work feels rough and calculated. The fingers study every inch of my arm before starting on the other. This time it is more painful. I now feel something in my left arm and the fingers do not carefully maneuver around it, instead opting to press on it and wiggle the part of the device that is protruding from my skin. My chest is next. The pressure is making it hard to breathe. The high pitched noise to my left begins to get more anarchic. I feel a stinging sensation on my arm. I black out.", "There is something going on. I can hear rustling, tapping and beeping. I open my eyes. It is bright. I avert my eyes from the light but it is all still too much for me to take in. There are many people in the room with me. All of them are moving briskly. The ceilings are high up, though many of the people in the room are not much shorter than it. The room is expansive, but it seems to be traversed quickly. One person is not moving. She is sitting on a green pad suspended from the ceiling. A series of wheels and beams shows that the pad can easily be moved around the room. I notice that I am on the same type of object. She is staring at me. Her gaze is unmoving and unbroken. She does not blink. Statue-like, if not for the odd shiver and hand tremble. She stands up and tries to walk but her legs give out. The beeping noise becomes louder and unmeasured. Her face contorts into an odd shape and she lets out an ear-piercing wail. One of the men in the room rushes to the cabinet next to her pad and pulls out a syringe, injecting her with it's contents. She becomes docile and her arm is quickly bandaged by another man. A woman looks to me and gestures to the man by the cabinet. Another syringe is readied and he begins to walk towards me. I start to cry and raise my arms in defense but he quickly overpowers me. I feel a stinging sensation on my arm. I black out.", "Once more I wake up in a new room. I am on a suspended pad, there is a cabinet near my head and desk next to it. The room is smaller than the last, though still large. A woman is sitting on a chair, writing something on a paper at the desk. A man walks in and they exchange words. I cannot hear what they are saying. The man makes a passing glance at me, his face red and his hand scratching at his unkempt facial hair, before quickly exiting the room. The woman puts down her pen and reaches out for a stamp. There are two, she grabs the one on the left and marks her paper with it. She presses a button on the wall and walks over to me. She puts one hand on the pad and the other caressing my cheek.", "\"Maybe next time little guy.\"", "Another woman enters the room. She has with her a pad much like mine but it is on wheels. She picks me up with two hands before cradling me with just one, grabbing the paper with her other hand. She sets me down gently, accidentally brushing the paper against my arm. She lets out a stifled \"Sorry\" before we start to move. I remember the bumps and the lights. This is not the first time, nor even the second time that I've been through this hallway. We arrive at the destination.", "\"Okay, hope you're ready.\"", "I feel a stinging sensation on my arm. She picks me up and puts me on another pad, this one inside of a large tube. She bandages my arm. \"Goodnight!\". The glass tube rotates and traps me in. I try to let out a cry, but I cannot. I feel cold. I black out.", "\"Wait, what?  So you never dehydrate because... You ", "  What the hell does that even mean!?\"  The deep booming voice echoed in the distance.", "\"Like a wet potato.  I just soak, I don't drink.  When I was a kid, the town idiot told me everyone who drinks water dies so I stopped!\"  I explained, as I laid tied to the stone alter.", "\"How do you not slurp any up if you're so thirsty!?\"   Another far less scary voice inquired.", "\"Quiet, Kenny, I'm the one who does the questions, remember?\"  The once booming voice responded quietly and less intimidating. ", "\"I piss in it!\"  I explained while attempting to move my head towards the direction of murmuring voices.  ", "\"He's messing with us.  Soaking in water instead of drinking it?  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\"  Said one woman.", "\"Russel, what about the ritual?\"  Another voice added.", "\"There will be no ritual today, Kenny.  We'll have to take his word on it.\"  The leader responded.  \"You there, immortal one.", "\nWe have been tracking you through the generations.  This group was formed by our forefathers long ago, and as it was foretold, we have found you and brought you here tonight to harness your life energy!\" The leader explained.", "\"You're a bunch of weirdos.\"  I responded quickly.  \"Yeah, and I wasn't even hiding.  You guys picked me up at an In-and-Out burger.  Did you even grab my burger for me or did you just stuff me in the bag and go!?\" ", "\"I think Eddie ate it.\"  A small voice answered.", "\"Did not!\"  Eddie contested.", "\"Jesus Eddie, you're supposed to be on a diet.\"  The leader scolded.", "\"Listen, I can appreciate how much time and effort went into your little ceremony here, but if you could just untie me and move this along?  That would be great.\" I demanded.", "\"SILENCE!\"  The leader commanded.  \"You will now reveal the source to your ancient and mystical power.\"  ", "\"Don't drink the water!  It's that simple.  Just soak in it, Christ almighty.  Is anyone else in charge here?\"  I pleaded.", "\"Clearly after hundreds of years of existence, you've grown extremely wise and now you're attempting to trick us by acting like a simpleton!\"  The leader said in a sinister voice.", "\"Uh, well, you'd think so, but sadly, no.\"  I answered back.", "\"What now?  Do we torture him?\"  A voice asked the leader.", "\"I didn't sign up for that.\"  Another voice scolded back.", "\"I guess we'll let him go.\"  The leader finally said.  \"This has been the most disappointing culmination of a cult's grand prophecy I've ever heard of.\" ", "She told me to 'keep my eyes pealed' and hung up.   I lost attention for a moment as i had drifted off thinking about this expression, but then remembered to blink. ", "This long stretch of nothing was in front of me and after squinting at the horizon for a while, i started thinking maybe i missed it, and that made me sad. I remembered Cathy and how we used to take long trips. I would point out nice plants, and she would tell me which of them can kill me. I would say i still think they're nice.  I missed her and could imagine if she was here with me she would have made this silence all the more quiet.", "I still looked ahead, conceptually pealing the lids away from my eyes, and waiting. It felt like i stood there for hours.  Hours of nothing but wind and more wind.\nI wanted to have a sip of water but i left it in the car that got me here.  I hope this doesnt take long.", "Bo came to a stop in front of the small dome hut. It's rocky surface did not fool him though. While it did look like an ordinary desert dweller's home he knew to be cautious. As he appraoched he unwrapped the cloth protecting his face from the harsh desert winds.", "Carefully he knocked on the small wooden door. Bo put his hand to his hip, a small weapon sat ready in its holster. The Watcher had sent him to elimnate the inhabitant of this home, apparently he was quite old and knew too much about the city's corrupted origins. Although barbaric in origin, Bo agreed to the task.", "Bo jumped a little as someone had finally answered the door, the assumed target. He was certainly a sight to see. He had a terrible slouch and time had shrunken him to the size of a small sand worm. His skin sagged and dragged on the ground from his body, but his face was probably the most peculiar. His eyes were complete black and mostly hidden by a hard squint. His wrinkles made his face look like the texture of stone. He beckoned Bo into his domain. Bo took his hand off his weapon, he wanted to see where this went.", "Careful not to step on the little man, Bo found a comfortable place to stand. The old man however hopped up into a rocking chair seeming to be made from the white trees that once towered over the now barren desert.

", "\"If your in need of directions I'm afraid I can't help with that,\" The old man said, \"Once the storms had rolled in I have never left my home, I too am unaccustomed to the land.\" Bo's jaw almost dropped but he kept an understanding face. The Watcher informed him this man was older than what was thought humanly possible but if he lived through the storms of legend he was far past 500 years old. Sort of creeped out Bo unbuckled his canteen from his belt. While he promised he wouldn't drink until Thursday he drank anyways. The old man stopped rocking in his chair, his face grew serious. ", "\"What are you drinking there young man?\" The old man asked desparately. Bo stopped drinking and licked his lips. If Bo told the truth he might put himself in possible danger. The liquid was a precious resource throughout the land and this man looked mighty thirsty. ", "\"W-water...\" Bo said impulsively. The old man quickly waddled up and snatched the canteen from Bo's dry hands. ", "\"No...\" The old man breathed in disbelief, \"surely there's no more...\" His hands quivered in temptation but he shoved the canteen back into Bo. \"Get that away from me,\" The old man demanded. Bo did as he was told.", "\"How long have you been drinking water?\" The old man asked.", "\"For as long as I can remember, sparingly.\" Bo answered the old man. The old man shook his head and sighed, his skin swayed with him.", "\"It's far too late for you, what a shame. You seem like a good man,\" The old man coughed out. He waddled over to a gagdet of his own creation, mixing sand and his own hair within it. As he turned a crank he glanced at Bo.", "\"How much did they pay you?\" The old man asked calmly. Bo stepped back, surely he wasn't talking about The Watcher and Bo's task, right? \"While physically I am weak, age has made my mind sharper than ever,\" The old man added.", "\"A few more gallons of water, that's what they're going to pay me,\" Bo gulped. He returned his hand to his weapon. The old man finished his mixture and poured into into another gadget, transporting that into the sunlight through a window. The mixture reacted to the light instantly and distilled into a smooth liquid. The old man picked it up and drank it. He then turned to Bo.", "\"Since I'm not already dead I believe your a good man to listen to reason. First, stop drinking water. Society still thinks we need that poison but after the first couple of thirst pains your body will adapt to live without water. If you stilk have pains there's other liquids that can ease the pain and won't poison you. Second, leave the desert, if you don't there's no hope humanity will survive any longer. Believe me when I say there's something past the desert, there nature is not the destructive force you think it is.\" The old man turns back to the window, \"age has prevented me from traveling or I would have left this wasteland.\" Finally the old man beckons Bo to leave and continues staring out the window.", "Bo, for some reason he can not explain, shrugs off his task and exits the home. He glances back at the old man's hut. At first he thought the old man's words were nothing but drops of insanity but a feeling deep inside believed every word. ", "Bo unbuckled his canteen and gave it a long hard look. He then chucked it into the wind that carried it away. Bo looked to the east, the same direction as the old man's window. That's where he was going.", "Y'know, I always thought that statistic was kind of stupid, but I never wanted to take any chances.

Railshots, for those who don't know, were intended solely for ranged empty space skirmishes, meant to rip open hulls and tear through engines. The only reason they weren't used in atmospheric battles was because accuracy could be off in such an enviroment, with increased gravity and the physics nightmare that is air itself. The humans, however, didn't seem to worry about such a thing, merely aiming their ships directly at the planet, and raining down tungsten rods like raindrops.  ", "Next were the dropships.

Some were indeed wielding the latest in plasma-pulse technology, firing miniature balls of perfectly round electric energy, while others had them slung across their backs, instead choosing to use what looked like tools that belonged in a museum. The metal was so dark, it looked like iron, and certain pieces, he thought he was dreaming, were they wood?  ", "The Gaouls couldn't stand up to it. Every single trick Treg could think of was pulled, including several he would never have considered, like small man excursions onto Gaoul ships to slam them into ground camps, pulling engines off grounded dropships just to overload them and have them turn city-sized plots of land into glass floors, and, he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw this, all 8 of them, slamming the Gaoul's moon into their homeworld in a secret military operation.

Treg, glancing around, saw a single man with a scowl on his face, running a stone down a piece of what seemed to be sharpened steel with a leather grip. In fact, there was much about the man that was odd. Instead of the lightly armored dark grey camouflage pants that seemed to be standard issue, he wore some odd, brightly colored open cloth. On his back was a series of bags that wheezed with his movements, as if they were their own creature.

", "In the human history there is man named Alexander whom they call 'the Great.' Alexander lead a vast army, which worshipped him, with which he conquered hundreds of kingdoms. He spread his noble culture to the far reaches of the world in an unbelievably short amount of time. However, there are legends that he was at least mildly insane. It is the belief of non-human species that this trait is what caused both him to be audacious enough to attempt the feats for which he became famous (even among the humans), and which humans are naturally more inclined. Man is mad, and it is that unrestrained human madness that pierces all other species with a cold dread when they hear, \"Man is coming.\"", "The humans have a saying: Ignorance is bliss. This sentiment, like the example of Alexander, lends credence to the cultural norm of willingly flinging themselves into high risk-high reward situations. Let me illustrate this with their first war, of many, with another species. The Luts were a race that was generally respected among the nobler galactic races, but today their name is spoken only after hesitation; it is not polite to bring it up in certain company. The Luts had sent a message to the humans that they owned the area into which the humans were expanding. It is unknown if they received or understood the message - it is most likely they simply ignored it. To Man's credit, the Luts did attack first. ", "After decimating the simplistic pioneer human ships, the Luts thought they'd be rid of the humans. It was the first exposure to alien technology they had ever had as a race. Surely they'd be conditioned not to fool with superior races. The Luts went back to their work and let their guard down. ", "Not a single standard solar cycle had passed when the Luts sent out distress signals to anyone who could receive them. The humans sent their entire space fleet to the exact coordinate where their first ships had been destroyed, opened fire with, would you believe it, physical and explosive projectiles, and did not let up for a single second for more than 500 hours straight. In space launching physical projectiles causes a ship to fly very unconventionally due to assymetric propulsions. Their ships flew crazily, absolutely impossible to anticipate their flight pattern. And if other human ships got in the way they were shot too! Energy shields do nothing against physical projectiles; the Lut ships, mining camps, colonies, everything was completey destroyed in the sector closest to the human home planet. In fact, human ships were still coming out of hyper-drive when their bombardment stopped, of course by that time the Luts had been obliterated. The point is, there's no way the humans had known about the energy fields' weaknesses, but in their ignorance they ran wildly into a fight. And they continued to run wild until the Luts, as they remain today, were economically crippled. As a side note, it is because of the humans that the new physhields had to be developed. But human ships? They continue to fly their ships naked, no shields at all. ", "Ok, I'm out of time. That's all.

When that is empty, they toss it away, to reduce their mass. They then light the end of the next barrel. And so on. In the end, about half a percent of the ship's mass actually arrives at the destination. The rest falls off. The entire ship is one-use only.

When American Cavalry - not armored, but literal cavalry mounted on horseback, sporting plate armor and wielding lances that would be feared throughout North Korea - had thundered across the DMZ, his border units were caught so off-guard that they were almost immediately overrun. By the time poor Kim could rally the shocked military, the combined South Korean and American forces had already seized much of the region south of Pyongyang, and inspired by the knights in shining armor the local peasantry had revolted against the oppressive regime.

While the West had rampaged through the lower half of True Korea, the Chinese had marched their own armies of antiquity into battle from the north, a terrifying force of both heavily armored infantry and rapid, Mongol-styled horsemen that served as advanced scouts and guerilla units, harassing the North Koreans with swarms of arrows before scurrying away from retaliation. It was an outright betrayal of Korea, but a stunning show of unity as the Chinese completed the encirclement of the now pitiful North Korea remnant, tied down to a single city with territory shrinking by the day.

Just as Park had his methods, so did Lee, and Bo had learned long ago that Lee excelled at extending the finest tendrils of influence everywhere he touched, such that he saw all, knew all, without anyone even realising he was observing. In Lee\u2019s world, the less of a paper trail, the better.", "So what was he to do, now that his two most trusted Colonels were telling him that everything he had expected of a war with the United States of America, was wrong?", "\u201cPermission to speak freely, Sir,\u201d said Park, adjusting his collar nervously.", "\u201cPermission granted,\u201d said Bo, as muscle memory took over and his knee gently nudged the switch under the desk to turn the recording devices back on.

Hardly any casualties from the arrows they fired from horseback, but mainly when they switched to catapaults and trebuchets.\u201d", "\u201cThese are the quarries they dug up their ammunition from,\u201d said Park, unfurling a map on the table and circling in red the locations he had committed to memory, \u201cand this is where we believe they are concocting the pitch they smear their boulders with.\u201d", "\u201cDo we even have defences against such unconventional warfare?\u201d", "\u201cDepends on what you mean by \u2018defences\u2019, Sir,\u201d said Lee. \u201cOur land-based mortars and missiles out-range their largest war machines, and since we destroy every one which comes into range, they\u2019ve been firing their flaming boulders from outside the safety perimeter. Suffice to say, none of their \u2018rounds\u2019 have ever hit any of our encampments.\u201d", "\u201cThen the casualties? How do you account for that?\u201d", "Park sighed as he withdrew a series of documents from his folder which Bo recognised as court-martial papers. \u201cSome of the men got bored, and they started playing a game where the man who stands the closest to enemy lines without getting smashed by falling rocks wins the collected pool\u2026 or should I say, WON the collected pool, aha, aha- sorry.\u201d", "Bo ignored the painful pun. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that actually we could have suffered zero casualties?\u201d", "\u201cHence the court-martials, Sir,\u201d said Lee, sniffing as he regarding the samples on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve also made it clear throughout the ranks that anyone taking part in such games will have their daily rations halved and their family members whipped.\u201d", "Bo sighed, then stood up to face the window, where the early blossoms stood in direct contrast with the darkened skies. He had been taught that every war they engaged in could be their last, and the pessimist in him had no idea how to deal with the success they\u2019ve had so far.", "\u201cAnd both of you still believe that this is all because our President challenged their President to a war by medieval means?\u201d", "Lee spoke first. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable. All our Supreme Leader said was that we would rain nuclear destruction on them if a single bullet was fired, and their President interpreted that as a challenge he could overcome. He said that woe is the American President who backs down from such a challenge, and that they would show the world that even 5th century technology was sufficient to destroy us.\u201d", "\u201cThis is what our spies are telling us?\u201d", "\u201cNo, Sir. It\u2019s from his Twitter page.\u201d", "Bo took a seat and massaged his temples. \u201cFine, whatever. Just tell me, what do we expect from the next 48 hours? Anything we can do to help our forces on the front?\u201d", "\u201cSir, we think that they will be trying a night assault this time. We have but the handful of drones we intercepted from Amazon, but they\u2019re telling us that the Americans are going to launch a pre-dawn raid.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what are our preparations against that?\u201d", "\u201cWe think they will be using bugles to coordinate the onslaught, so we\u2019ve already prepped recordings of the acoustic trash those Southern-rebels listen to in their leisure.

The road to full-fledged legitimacy still lay a great way ahead, but it was every effort like this, every conscious commitment to improve, which would perhaps give them a fighting chance at the end of the day.", "\u201cVery well.

The Secretary didn't laugh, and in seconds the room was deadly silent. ", "\"Let me get this straight.\" General Seneca was the one to speak. \"You're asking us to topple a regime, without guns?\" Anger flared up inside of him, followed by a mixed patriotic excitement as he remembered the damage his people had inflicted on American pioneers centuries before using nothing but spears and arrows. \"You didn't spare any bullets on my people.\"", "But the plan was set in motion, and Seneca found himself placed in charge of the whole operation on the basis of his knowledge of primitive war fighting techniques. He did, after all, teach the class in archery at the Academy. ", "The secretary laid out the rules of engagement. Kim Jong Un had issued a very specific threat: that he would retaliate with nuclear force at the firing of the first American bullet. To be safe, our forces would rule out shells and missiles as well. Combat would have to be accomplished without firearms of any kind. But there would be no restrictions on defensive and logistical technology. ", "\"Well, this is going to be fun,\" harrumphed another general. And he was right. ", "Seneca found himself tasked with training and leading the Army's first airborne crossbow archer division. He was impressed by the haste with which Barnett fulfilled their first-ever military contract. Each paratrooper was issued an 18\" crossbow and a backpack full of nearly 200 bolts. Marines would follow, bearing broadswords and bayonets. Thankfully, no restrictions were imposed on body armor, so Seneca saw to it that each soldier and marine was equipped with head to toe Kevlar, a flak jacket, and a helmet with a visor.  Close combat would require a slight upgrade from the standard field armor kit, just to be on the safe side.  After all, most of the troops would be unable to retaliate over any distance.  ", "When the assault finally began, losses were heavy from the start.  The airborne was first, dropping directly over Pyongyang.  Seneca could only imagine the frustration of the pilots watching helplessly as their comrades were gunned down, unable to drop ordinance or even fire upon the obvious ground installations.  It had to be in and out as quickly as possible.  First were the soldiers themselves.  And what a sight that must have been for the enemy.  Most soldiers had their crossbows engaged against the enemy before they even hit the ground, but dozens were shot out of the air.  It was pure carnage.  The heavy equipment fared somewhat better.  Hundreds of Humvees and APCs were airdropped into the streets of Pyongyang, and the soldiers inside fared significantly better.  DARPA had done quite a job converting a batch of Abrams tanks from artillery to mechanical ballistas, but it was the crews\u2019 own improvisations that really impressed.  If you\u2019ve never seen a turret with a sword mounted to the end of an idle gun, it\u2019s worth seeing.  Kim\u2019s ground troops were simply no match for our vehicles even without guns.  ", "Our archers took heavy losses, but inflicted as much as they took.  In an hour, they were inside of bunkers taking out enemy soldiers one at a time.  Tear gas was surprisingly useful when bullets weren\u2019t available, and the disoriented enemy was helpless against our bolts and knives as they floundered for breath.  ", "As the battalion approached the Kim\u2019s palace in Pyongyang, a piercing shriek was heard overhead, and the building abruptly collapsed in a pile of rubble. Seneca was outraged and radioed in to central command. \"What the hell was that? I thought we said no bullets?\" The Secretary laughed. \"Apparently the Admirals didn't realize the railguns were off limits. It's basically a modern day ballista, I suppose.

He looked at the expanse of the night sky, light that died thousands of years of go finally reaching his eyes. He had often used the night sky to clear his head, to do a meditation of sorts. Tonight was different. You see earlier that day Will had been ousted from his cushy job at the conglomerate he had worked for as part of a large corporate coup. Will had given fifteen years to the company, he had given all of his adult life since college to the company, increased profits by thirty percent year over year, Will had been banished as the new CEO created a massive overhaul of the system and removed any remnants of the past organization that may threaten his power. Will contemplated his options, he knew it was not likely he could walk into the office anymore due to the building\u2019s high security. He also knew there was no company nearly large enough he could join to challenge the consolidated power of the conglomerate. It seemed that Will was out of options. He gazed deep into the night sky, looking, grasping for something, anything that could give him peace of mind. He saw a flash, it shot across the sky like a bullet. Was that a shooting star?

He walked into his kitchen and saw his wife standing there, he had told her immediately of the new of his job loss and she was not pleased. Jess had berated him all morning and continued to act as if she no longer loved him later that evening. Will wondered if she had ever truly loved him, or if she had just loved the idea of him, the money, the house, the cars that he paid for. He wondered this from the moment he told her. He couldn\u2019t bear to think of it anymore for the day. He had already thought so much. He barreled past her as he made his way for the stairs. \u201cWill\u201d she said.

It had to be mid day the sun shone into his room as he struggled to rise, he still felt a pressure in his chest as if someone had knocked the wind out of him.

One time, I grabbed the controller from him and he spit in my face. I don't talk to Jason anymore. He said, \"I don't want to be your friend anymore!\" then he laughed at me when I started crying. The last thing he said to me was, \"Man, your house smells like smoke!\" My house didn't smell like smoke though. My parents don't smoke. I'm too young to smoke. I said his house smelled like smoke once. I guess it made him mad. I didn't mean it as an insult. Why do I say things? It never does any good to talk to people.

I'm the last of the Asteri team, volunteering my time after work to check on the final satellite in orbit.  I'm not sure why I offered to keep up with the program really.

It didn't take long to delete the messages, as being a magic genie is actually quite difficult when you have no magic or money to speak of.  I went through the program's navigation menu, took a last look at the program, and decommissioned the satellite, Upon decommission, it's smartbox technology, the part of the satellite that has the powerful tracking technology, was ordered to detach itself and land in an abandoned lot not far from my house.  Wouldn't want this kind of technology to fall into the wrong hands after all.  Sighing, I put on my coat and some music and began walking to get the smartbox.

From his place in life, his healthy body, his healthy mind. Deep down he'd like to think he'd be different, but would he? Didn't he too, like everyone, harbor the illusion that he would live forever? Didn't he make plans and live his life like he wasn't going to die one day, despite his 'logical' mind knowing it fully well? Didn't he too bury this truth?

The buzzer sounds.  And the shot is...", "\"BABY!\" screeched Cindy.  Her outburst made me tear my eyes away from the game before I could catch what happened.

It was Kelvin suavely landing on his feet, even managing to give me a sneaky wink as he did. That bastard knew I\u2019d land on my ass and probably saw me as I did actually fall on it.", "He then went on one knee, facing the highest of the thrones, \u201cThis is my beloved wife. I have brought her to live with me as I carry out the mission to save Other Earth.\u201d I panicked and quickly followed suit, settling down on one knee beside him.

He was excited and was talking nonsense to her sleepy brain, but when he put a flower like any other she have seen in her life next to her head on the pillow, the weird smell of the quickly fading beauty woke her up completely. \"Wait, John, are you telling me there is a dimmensionbreak in OUR bathroom?\" She wiped her eyes and yawned. This is not happening, she told herself. \" I need to go pee now I am awake.\" She complained to him and quickly covered herself in her dressing gown as she went on her way. John took her hand. \" Do you trust me, Jane?\" He asked simple and without any colour in his voice.

Please, hold my hand and do not let go.\" Jane nust nodded as she gave him her hand and side by side they entered the bathroom door. \nJane immediatelly felt immense pressure on their firm grip, and she felt as John squeezed her hand even more and so did she.

What do they eat?\" She asked and pointed on the hord catching the redlight and resting on the porch.\n\"Are you hungry?\" He asked, surprised. \n\"No, it's just a.. habit probably.\" She finished her reply with a slight anxiety. He laughed. \" That is the beauty of this place. We will never have to worry about getting food, about money, about the weather or whatever. Everything is perfect here and it stays perfect.\" He laughed again happily as he hugged her and whispered into her ear \"I love you.\" \nIt was a big world, and Jane was enjoying her adventurous side more and more as she grew older. Nothing changed on the outside. Her face was still as pretty as when they originally came here. She felt older, though, and the resentment to this world grew bigger and bigger. It may be the perfect world for John, but for her.. it was empty. Just empty. Nothing lived here, as long as nothing died here it could not have actually been alive in the first place. Nothing could be born, either. It felt like a museum of some sort. A world museum. And she was living in it for too many years now. John was happy here and that was the only reason why she agreed they would stay. But as the years were running along, she was growing more and more resentfull to this museum of a world, to the smells and weird beauty of this paused place and even to John.\nOne day, she climbed on top of the biggest mountain of this world, and as she stood there looking with geniune disgust all around she finally made her decission.

Then, as quickly as it had started, it was over, and I was lying on my back on a hard, moist and muddy floor. The sounds of thunder where louder now, the heavy rain drops had already left my clothes soaking and the lightning bolts above flashed through my eyes. When I opened my eyes, I could see Sophia already standing, in front of me, speaking to some men that seemed to be wearing plate armor.

I run a hand through my hair, letting a wave of exhaustion course through me.", "\u201cCome on, Jared!\u201d Tara says, \u201cYou have to come with me. I think we can go back.\u201d", "I stand firm, shaking my head slightly. I don't want to come and see the proof that she's still crazy. Lightning flashes outside, and the single bare bulb that lights up our apartment's bedroom flickers. A brief burst of machine gun fire and a few distant shouts cut through the night. The muties are rioting again, I guess. I don't really care. Let them riot.", "Tara's smile fades. \u201cWhy not? There's nothing left here for us,\u201d she says, \u201cIt's the end of this world, and the beginning of that other world.\u201d", "She's right\u2014well, right except for the last part. It is the end of the world. There's nothing here but plains of ash and bombed-out shells of cities. Earth is just running out the clock on us. Still, I have no words. Instead, I wrap her in an embrace that offers no comfort. There is a long silence, broken only by the endless patter of the rain outside. Black rain\u2014it always is these days. I no longer think much about the clear rain from when I was younger. What's the point? It doesn't exist. Probably never will.", "Tara pulls away and tugs on my sleeve. \u201cCome on,\u201d she says softly, \u201cDon't you see? We can start over in the other world. We can build a better life there. I've already got a house, a garden, everything ready...all that's missing is you, Jared. And the baby...they can't stop us from having one there. There's nobody to care if it's a mutie.\u201d\nTara gazes into my face with one soulful blue eye and I cave. \u201cShow me,\u201d I murmur. Hell, maybe she's right and I'm crazy. I can hope.", "Tara half-leads, half-drags me into the bathroom. I survey the small, cramped room with its peeling paint, chipped tiles, rusting sink. A few feet away is the shower. Water still drips from the shower head. And that's it. Definitely no portal to another world.", "Tara turns to me, her expression radiant. \u201cIt's still there. Let's go right now, okay?\u201d she says.", "I allow myself another glance at the shower. Some small part of me really badly wants to see a portal there, but I tell that part to shut up. There's nothing there.", "I can't take it anymore. \u201cThere's nothing there, Tara!\u201d I snap.", "\u201cOpen your eyes! Why can't you see? It's right there!\u201d Tara shouted back, pointing to thin air.", "I lose it in that moment. I grab Tara's shoulders and turn her to face me. \u201cNo, you open your damn eyes! You're just another goddamned crazy!\u201d I shout. I release her, breathing heavily.", "Tara steps back, a hurt expression on her face. There are a few tears in her eyes. \u201cTh...that's not all I am, Jared, is it? Y...you know that. Please tell me you know that. I know I've sometimes seen things that aren't there, but I'm not stupid. I...I'm not useless. I pull my weight, help us both survive. Right? Right?\u201d she says shakily.", "I shove my anger back down, an act which takes all my willpower. I can be a monster sometimes. I hate myself for it, but that changes nothing. I pull Tara closer and gently touch her face. It's partly marred by radiation burns, but what's left is still beautiful.", "\u201cYou're right. I'm so sorry,\u201d I say, \u201cI didn't mean that.\u201d  I take a deep breath, \u201cTara, please just trust me like I trusted you in those first few days after you pulled me out of the rubble. Like we've trusted each other since. We've always looked out for each other. I've never lied to you. I never will. I swear on my life. You have to believe me, Tara. There's no portal, no other world. You forgot your meds, you had a hallucination in the shower, you slipped and fell. It's not real.\u201d", "Tara takes a long look at the shower. I can tell when I've finally convinced her\u2014all trace of hope flees her face. There's only despair left, surrounding an empty shell. She says nothing, only leaves shakily. I hear her flop down on the bed, hear a few muffled sobs.", "It occurs to me that I don't know how badly I've hurt her. I guess I should've let her keep her fantasy. I'm a monster. Again...no always. Or maybe not. I don't know\u2014I was trained as a journalist, not a psychiatrist. And now I'm neither, just another survivor. What would I know? Far away, the gunfire starts up again.", "I sit down on the rim of the tub and let the tears come to me as well.", "........", "EDIT: Still getting used to the formatting here.", "\"Jude!\" He called out, \"Hey Jude, honey, you here?\" ", " he thought to himself, ", "Quinn sat down on on the couch centered in their tiny studio apartment.

She locked eyes with Quinn, who was quite startled, and nearly pounced into him with an embrace.", "\"I never stopped loving you!\" She exclaimed as she took his hand. \"We have to go back, there's so much you need to see!\"", "Quinn looked at her, perplexed, \" Hon, are you OK? I was only at work-\"", "\"Just trust me,\" she interrupted, \"It will all make sense soon!\"", "She pulled him up and towards the glowing bathroom.

There was nothing to the couple, no thoughts or ego, just the feeling of each other's hands, then the light flooded through.", "Quinn looked around, startled at the change in scenery. There were flowers of various shades all around him, and a beautiful purple mountain-scape in the background. An overwhelming feeling of relief flooded his senses and he couldn't help but shed tears of joy as he pulled Jude to him.", "They both whooped with bliss as they experienced life for the first time. No more obligations, no working two jobs to pay for a crummy apartment, no more negativity, and no more leading the life neither of them wanted.

Then I looked at my wife, and the glimmer of joy and wonder in her eyes.", "She whispered to me, \"They have unicorns, David. ", "\"", "Fuck it, lets go. Anything's better than this.", "A tick wracked his body as something broke in the bathroom.", "Allie? Darling? Everything OK?", "He heard some shuffling behind the shut door. Scraping of fingernails against the white paint and wood.", "He hurried to the door and almost had his hand on the brass knob when a hand turned it from the other side and ripped the door open.", "Brandon! Oh my god! It's been so long and you're still here! Her eyes were wild and a bit unfocused. I figured you'd be dead, or gone, or at least older! She inspected her own hands before her and frowned. I need to wash up a bit. Small crescents of impacted dirt had built up under her nails.", "Alright, alright I'll let you clean up, but did something break in here? Pushing his head inside he did see the mirror piece had fallen and broken into more pieces. Be careful Allie, I need to clean that up. Let me go get the broom.", "She paid him no attention. Brown water dripped from the faucet over her hands. Her clothes were fine, at least they hadn't been torn up this time.", "In the kitchen he opened a cabinet and retrieved a can of potatoes and snagged the cylinder of propane from the hiding spot behind the washer. Carefully he screwed it into the camping stove and set the pot on top before depressing the ignition a few times. Fortunately the spark caught with only 6 strikes. He frowned- it was getting colder by the day. Two and a half cylinders was not going to last till April. Hopefully it didn't have to. With the pot set, he turned to the closet to get the broom.", "Something crashed outside their apartment, further down the hall. The muscles in his heart slammed adrenaline through his veins with an audible tha-thump. His hands were shaking as he whittled the can open with a bottle opener. After turning the can upside down in the pot, he crept to the door and carefully looked through the peephole. He was careful not to lean on the door to keep it from making a sound. It was only now that he heard the shouting and another thump.", "His muscles tensed involuntarily. The shouted words barely came through the door- in! Let me in!", "Another thudding sound came from the other direction. He craned his head but couldn't see- two men dashed down the dark hallway towards the sound. That's all he had saw before he ducked out of sight of the peephole.", "He crawled across the floor to the camper stove and turned it off quietly. His hands could barely maintain a solid grasp on the pot handle as he scurried back to the bathroom to make sure Allie was alright.", "She was standing in the hallway. Her eyes had a worried curiosity. What is it Brandon? Everything OK? Her voice was cluelessly loud.", "He put a shaking finger to his lips and shouldered her into the bathroom. Shivers were running through his body. The pot clinked in the sink as he tried to quietly set it down. He closed the door and darkness swept over them.", "Brandon? What is it?", "Shh was the only thing he could utter between his clenched teeth.", "It was then that his body began to nearly convulse. As shells screamed out of the sky and nearby explosions rocked the building, every muscle in his body pulsed involuntarily. He curled his knees to his chin and pulled them tight to his chest with his arms. He pulled until it hurt.", "In the dark, Allie fumbled towards him. Her warm touch fell softly on his shoulders, pulling him into her with a gentle hug. It did little for the tremors, but Brandon could feel his heart beating lighter.", "There there. We'll be there soon. She said quietly.", "He could feel her breath on his face. Her cheek against his. He couldn't relax. But he leaned into her. Pressing his face into her neck and chest. He unwrapped his arms from around his knees pitifully hung them from her neck. The sobs came quietly at first.", "The air was warm. Grass tickled the bare skin on his arms. A bright sun pierced his eyelids.", "Opening his eyes greeted him with a completely unfamiliar sight. Green mountains rose in the distance. Waving grass that flashed red and green in the breeze. As he turned surveying the landscape, he spotted a simple log house nearby.", "Are you feeling better Brandon? He turned around. Allison was sitting in the grass behind him. You always drool so much when you sleep. She stood.", "Where are we?", "She smiled and held her arms out to embrace him. She pulled him close. And whispered in his ear.", "Home.", "Keiko stood stiffly as Miles squeezed her arms and shook her, consumed by urgency. \"We have to hurry back! Hundreds of years are passing as I speak!!!\" His face was twisted by a mix of fear and excitement - an expression Keiko had grown to know well. Julian had been away for weeks now, and Miles appeared to be slipping into one of his regular delusions that seemed to flare up whenever his best friend was unavailable. ", "\"Miles, I understand that it feels very real to you, but it seems pretty unlikely that one family would have this happen to them three times... I mean, it was already pretty unusual the first time when you were imprisoned by that alien race and forced to live a whole lifetime in jail in your mind, and the second time when Molly disappeared through a time portal down on Bajor was an extraordinary coincidence. What do you think the chances are that our sonic shower has become a gateway to another dimension with, surprise surprise, a time dilation effect? Maybe I should call...\" \"KEIKO this isn't a dream or a delusion - I've built us a house on in beautiful valley; there are ACRES and acres for you to landscape with any variety of plant. I've worked the soil and made it all ready for you! Sure, thousands of years have now passed since we started this conversation and I'll have to start over again from scratch, but that's okay! It can't possibly be more frustrating than what I do here on the station! The kids can come too, and they'll always be safe there with us. And best of all, any time we want to come back, no matter how long it's been, we can step right back into our lives here as if nothing happened! I can come back and be Chief of Operations... whenever I want. Or not.\"", "Keiko looked imploringly into her husband's eyes. \"Miles, please! I know you're finding it hard to keep up at work, and there's always something to fix - something wrong. But that's who you are! That's what you do - what you're best at. Running away to hide in the shower has never helped before, and it won't help now. Just go talk to the Captain and tell him you need more staffing opened up in your department. I'm sure he'll understand. Look how helpful he was when I wanted to open the school! He gave me whatever I needed; maybe you just need to be more honest about what you need, instead of always making do.\"", "Miles threw his hands up in the air, raising his voice; \"Keiko this is ridiculous! I'm leavin' and you can come or not.\" and with that Miles stamped off to sit in the shower and build a new world all over again. This time he'd build a racquetball court so Julian could come stay when he got back from the conference \"HE'LL appreciate all of this.\" Miles mumbled to himself, as Keiko went back to tending her Idran hybrids carefully. Sometimes she missed life on The Enterprise; Miles may have been bored in the transporter room, but at least he wasn't so stressed he had to concoct fantastical alternate dimensions to escape his job. ", "\"Sisko to O'Brien - we have a situation on upper pylon 2 that needs your attention immediately. Kira will meet you there.\" \"Yes sir...\" Miles said sadly, putting aside his plans for the racquetball court for the time being. ", "She stood in front of me, eyes gleaming. Her hands clasped mine as she tugged me towards the bathroom.", "\"Other dimension?\"", "Her head nodded eagerly.", "\"1000 years?\"", "Her head bobbled more vigorously.", "\"Dragons?\"", "She grinned and her head almost fell off from the momentum of her nod.", "I pulled my hand from hers, and my fingers immediately began pulling at my hangnails. I eyed my wife nervously. She looked exactly the same when she had entered the bathroom five minutes ago. Maybe slightly more disheveled? Could just be my imagination though.", "I gestured cautiously towards her general direction. \"Why are you still wearing your pajamas if it has been a thousand years? Did you wear your pajamas the entire time? That seems odd, right? I mean, nothing is different...\"", "My voice trailed off because that was wrong. She was different, in her straight posture, the confidence in her voice. She possessed the almost annoying air of someone who has found herself through interesting and life changing adventures, and now knew with certainty on how the world worked. She reminded me of my sister after she took that college trip to save orphans in Tibet. My nose wrinkled in worry.", "\"Oh god, you had a stroke.\" I moaned.", "\"Nononono. No.\" She waved her arms in protest. \"No strokes. No brain tumors. No aneurysms. No... Nothing. Nothing medically is wrong. I just a found a magic portal... which returned me in my original pajamas.\" She stared at her old and ragged fleece shirt in confusion. \"And I gained back all that weight. Huh, now that you mention it, that is a weird detail.\"", "I looked at her aghast. \"Can you smell toast? I hear that is an early sign of strokes.\" I sniffed the air and gasped. \"I can smell toast. Are we both having strokes?\"", "\"Oh, by Stalo's Oar, I am not having a stroke! You are not having a stroke! You are making breakfast!\" She stared at me momentarily before sighing and looking towards the ceiling for help. \"Geromi said this was a bad idea. I probably should've listened.\"", "\"You remembered I was making breakfast after a thousand years?\"", "Her eyes snapped in anger, and I felt a rumble go through my spine. I meekly looked away. ", "\"Look. Just... just humor me okay?\" Her voice was soft, but had a hint of desperation. \"I haven't seen you in a thousand years. It took me forever to figure out how to get back. To get back to you. I've missed you so much, that all I can remember was the last moment I saw you. With your bedhead, your glasses sagging on your nose. Wandering around half sleep, making breakfast in an almost terrifying manner. I defeated dragons, allied with wizards, and saved kingdoms. And all of it was because I had to get back here. To this moment.\"", "There was silence as she looked deeply into my eyes. A small bit of laughter hesitatingly broke from my lips. \"Wow, you've gotten really good at expressing yourself. That felt like something out of a movie.\"", "\"Yeah, the whole heart felt speech thing was really big over there. I got pretty good at it. But everything I said was true.\"", "I shrugged helplessly. \"If I humor you, and nothing happens, we'll drop this, okay? Well, not totally drop. We should probably take you to a doctor. Or a therapist. Or both.\"", "That self assured grin again spread across her face. She leaned forward, pressing her temple against mine. She breathed in deeply before pulling me towards the bathroom. \"You won't regret it.\"", "Moments later, I was gasping on the ground. Dirt shook under my hands as a woman who looked remarkably like my wife jumped around an ogre with a broadsword. Except, she was wearing armor, had long hair done up in dashingly disheveled braids, and had an exceptionally toned body. With a flip and a tumble under grasping fists, the heavy weapon swung upwards and she pierced the throat of the monster. Green blood spewed forth, and the large ogre stumble backwards with a ragged bubbling. With a setting sun silhouetting his grotesque form, he fell backwards dramatically off a cliff we happened to be near. ", "The woman posed before me, where a few splatters of blood made her look heroic but not disgusting. \"Well, that wasn't the best first impression of the place.\" She quipped. ", "A tree crashed down near me. \"Huh, you don't say.\"", "She knelt next to me. \"No worries. We are like the heroes in this world. We are destined to survive anything in order to save this world.\"", "\"You mean, you are.\"", "She looked at me quizzically. \"What do you mean?\"", "\"The toilet brought you here. You alone. But not me. Toilet didn't give me a second glance.\"", "\"I am not following you. You are here now-\"", "\"Because of you! The hero from another world. You are either supposed to learn some life lesson but then return to your old life with a new purpose, or stay in this new world with a new purpose. You aren't, well, you can't be mixing them around!\"", "I sighed, and looked at the sickly beautiful scenery around me. Quivering leaves, babbling brooks, a worrisome cloud of dust moving in our direction. She followed my gaze, and her lips tightened.", "I got up and wiped down my jeans. \"I've played enough RPGs to know how this turns out. At best, I just become a lowly merchant who gives you good deals on items. At worst, I die a tragic death to move along your character development. Any which way, that roving dust will have nothing positive in it for me.\"", "I looked stoically into the distance, and a wind swept the hair across my eyes. The deepening sun casted moody shadows down upon us through the building clouds. I groaned, and shook my head irritably and stepped defiantly into the last bit of sunlight. \"Shit, it's already happening. Where's a pub?\"", "Her face brightened and she eagerly took my hand. \"Oh, I knew you would come around. Are we are going on a quest?\"", "\"Wow, you still don't get it.\" She smiled and tilted her head in question. Her wide blue eyes looked at me with love and excitement. My heart trembled and my ball of rage and fear crumbled momentarily. I took her hand. \"Eh, whatever. Sure, going on a quest. Let's get to a pub. I need to figure out how to become a minor character who isn't needed to drive any story lines.\"", "It was only a moment ago when he stepped into the shower, but there he was, standing in my living room. Arm outstretched as if to hold my hand.\n\"How?\" I whispered.\nHe nodded, as if he knew what I was thinking. Smiled, like I was about to be let in on a personal joke of his. \n\"Everything will be explained, once we get home.\" He said with calm certainty. \nBut we were home. I was standing in our living room. He must have seen the increased confusion behind my eyes.\nQuickly, he grasped my hand. Firm yet gentle.\n\"We don't have time to talk,\" he said. \"It's highly unstable and I was only able to keep it open for a few earth minutes\"\nQuickly we walked down the hall to the bathroom. I noticed his beard now. Full with a small amount of grey. He couldn't grow a full beard, it was always patchy. The lines around his eyes began crease as with the limp in his gate got worse. He was in pain, pain that he knows well. His knee from the accident must be flared up again.\nThen we were there looking at the tub.\n\"Step in and jump\" he whispered into my ear with a kiss.\nSo I did. Our home, he had built was perfect. I heard a crack. The portal had closed. I was alone.", "\"BABE, I'M SERIOUS. I FELL INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION. RIGHT THERE IN THE JOHN.

Or you've been drinking shower beers again.\"", "Brian looked shocked & hurt. \"I don't do that.\"", "\"I found a Bud Light behind my shampoo yesterday,\" I said, rolling my eyes.", "Brian looked impatient. \"Okay, that was one time. Geez. But for real, just come to the bathroom and see what I mean.\"", "I sensed Brian was up to something. But what ? Then I had an idea. \"Fine. But you must agree to a deal first.\"", "\"Go on.\"", "I leaned across the breakfast table, showing just enough cleavage to distract Brian. \"I'll come inspect this so called other dimension with you. If there's an honest to God portal to another world, I will call up my hottest girlfriend & ask her to have a three way with us.\"", "Brian's eyes bugged out in anticipation.", "\"But if this is a trick to show me a poo shaped like Lincoln again, you have to do all the chores for a year. All the cooking, cleaning, laundry, every single thing.\" ", "Brian's bottom lip quivered. \"I'm gonna take my shower beers down to the recycling bin.\" ", "Trillian came running out of the bathroom despite only having run in 15 seconds prior to this very sentence.

Sadly, after a check up with the oncologist, it was clear that nothing was going to be normal again with a few days slipping away before us, as I was soon expected to pass away.", "I have never been a religious man, but the morning when the miracle came was probably the closest I ever came to some kind of religious revelation.

Could four weeks in the gym really do that?", "\u201cHi Kim, now get ready, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d David shot her a mischievous smile. \u201cUnless you want me to call in\u2026\u201d His boss would cut him some slack as long he wasn\u2019t too late.

Are you having a stroke or something?\u201d He kept his arms around her loosely in case she needed support, but really she didn\u2019t seem weak at all.", "\u201cNah, no I mean. David, please. I haf been gone.\u201d The strange accent seemed to be lessening as she continued speaking with more confidence. \u201cDavid, our shower is a portal gate to another, ah place. I have been away for a long time and hardly anyone there speaks English. David, you have to believe. I have been fighting for so long to be able to return to you.\u201d", "\u201cWhat, Kim, seriously? What the hell? Come on we need to get to work.\u201d David let go of her reluctantly. \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t want a shower, I\u2019ll get going on mine.\u201d He tried to walk past her, but she blocked him, her lean, naked body again brushing against his chest.", "\u201cNo David. I\u2019m never going to work again. I am going back. I want you to come with me. This other place is incredible. It\u2019s like right out of a Tolkien book, and I\u2019m like Galadriel there. I mean, I can do freakin\u2019 magic! David, I\u2019ve been fighting so long. SO. LONG. To find the things I needed to get back here for you. Come with me.\u201d", "\u201cThis is crazy Kim, and I really don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Or did she just want him to join her in the shower? It had been a while. What exactly did she mean by \u201cmagic\u201d? He smiled at her again, but there was no playfulness in her eyes. She looked earnest.", "\u201cDavid, come with me. I am going now, and I want you to come with me. To rule by my side. Come with me now.\u201d She took his hand and lead him into the bathroom. The shower door was open and it looked normal to him. He wasn\u2019t as agile as he used to be, but he was happy to squeeze into the small shower space with his newly hot, naked wife.", "She turned toward the shower knobs and David took the opportunity to reach around her and\u2026"], "SUBREDDIT": "WritingPrompts", "SCORE": 16366, "TOTAL": 758, "TYPE": 1}

You okay?\" Tony cried out from behind me.", "\"Fine,\" The impact had landed me on my tailbone, which was a little sore, but otherwise I was fine.

And she hadn't blamed me.", "I could have cried myself, but my tears had been exhausted long ago.

She doesn't look angry. I'm confused. \"You could try talking to me do everyone doesn't think I'm crazy.\" I look around and see everyone staring at her, confused.

Well, unless you're one of the masked men. You see, most people have small gifts. Little things that give them an advantage. Maybe they can always figure out just how much volume something holds. Maybe they never need to sleep. Some people are always just a little warmer than normal. It's actually a lot nicer than it sounds. Winter in Boston? No problem. Sahara desert? Just a little warm. ", "I'd take any of those in a second. But me? I don't really know. Animals just seem to like me. But I can't control when or how. When I was a toddler, some local coyotes kidnapped me. The police were looking for me for 4 days. But mostly it's the annoying ones. Do you know how many insects followed me home just to die all over the place? It doesn't help that my dad was an uptight neat freak. I guess that's what happens when you can always see just how infectious something is. He's a great restaurant inspector though. ", "But what happens when you're with that someone - I've seen it - It's like you have a volume knob on your power. That guy who's warm? He was my neighbor. When he and his wife go camping, he could start fires with his fingertips. He could turn it does too so it wasn't like sleeping on a radiator. ", "So yeah, it would be great to find that person for me, and I think I could be amazing if I could control my powers. We could fly letters to each other with crows and ride tigers and have a picnic in the middle of the ocean on the back of a whale. I could do so many things for her that no one else could do. And who knows what she could do? It's hard not to be a hopeless romantic when there's so many magical couples around you. People who just fit. They're perfect. I want to be perfect. But for now, cockroaches follow me around, my house is always infested with rats, and it's hard to get a date when you always have a distinct aura of pigeon shit about you. And I know pretty much everyone is looking for their special someone. I don't know if I'm ever gonna find her. I don't even know what power she would have. ", "One day, I'm going to work, trying to slam the door to my building shut so that a stray cat doesn't try to give me a \"present\" in my cubicle when I hear someone scream down the way. I run over and see others do the same when I see a dog with froth in his mouth and murder in his eyes. A woman is trapped between two stores by the dog and I know I have to do something. I walk over to the dog and start petting. It looks up on me and its eyes cool off. His tail starts to wag and he almost smiles. Before you know it, animal control is there and I can coax the dog into a crate. They take it away, and I'd like to say I care about what happens to the poor thing, but all I can think about is this mysterious woman. I've never been able to calm down something like that. That's the closest I've ever gotten to being able to control anything about my power. I think she can see the starstruck wonder in my eyes because she looks at me and laughs. She thanks me for saving her from the dog and I awkwardly mumble something. I'm not really comfortable with being thanked. ", "Sara. She tells me her name is Sara. I know from the moment I see her that she is the one for me. I ask her on a date and she agrees! Screw it, I don't need to come into work today. Besides, most people understand that things like this are more important than working. Besides, some people never meet their soulmate. I thought for a long time that I never would but Sara. Sara. I take her to this little Italian place on 32nd and talk for hours. I laughed, and she laughed. I honestly don't remember a whole lot of specifics but I think my face hurt from smiling so much. I do remember that I asked her what her power was when I noticed something moving in the window. This place had fresh herbs by the window and it looked like some wind was blowing outside. No, wait, it was only one of the basils. It was dancing. ", "\"Yeah, that's pretty much all I can do, she said, nervously smiling and brushing her hair out of her eyes. You should see how much ivy is on my building.\"", "\"You should see how many bird nests are on mine.\"", "Her laugh is practically melodious and I can help but be elated. I don't yet know exactly how our powers will interact - sometimes it take a while - but we could have a little farm somewhere. I think that'd be nice. For a while we just sit there staring at each other and smiling, hopefully thinking the same thing.", "I hear the door open and notice a man come in the restaurant. I don't think I would have noticed him but he is practically bathed in sunlight. The glowing man walks by our table and something happens - he turns purple. I think he is as surprised as everyone else is because he stops and stare at his hands, mouth agape. Sara turns around to look at this glowing man and the light changes back to sunlight. He looks at her and his glow starts to pulse and softens to a pink sunset. Out of the corner of my eye I can see the basil practically erupting out of the flower pot. For a while, nobody moves. Nothing happens but the pulses of light and the basil having a field day outside. Sara slowly turns back to me with an apologetic face and I know what she means. I pay for my meal and leave the restaurant, walking away from the warm glow and the ringing laughter.", "At this point I don't really know what to do. I get in my car and drive off to the middle of nowhere. I'm so sick of this. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of trying to find someone. I'm sick of wanting to feel complete. Some people just settle. They stick with someone who makes them smile and keeps them warm tonight. But you can tell they're just not perfect like the others, the ones who found each other. ", "I eventually stop in a field. I get up and wander around for a bit and I start to cry. I feel ridiculous crying in the middle of a field with my car parked on the side of a road. I feel exposed. There's some trees close by and I walk over to feel sheltered. To feel invisible. To feel like I don't have eyes on my back. I don't know how long I sit next to a tree, crying. I do know that I'm kinda snapped out of it by thunder. And then the rain starts to come down. Perfect. I get up, wipe my face off, and start to walk back to the car when a bear crashes out of the forest. Shit. I really don't want a bear following me around. I can probably get around it to get to the car. The bear walks towards me. I'm trying not to shit myself. The bear gets closer. I try harder not to shit myself, and I try to emanate calming energy to the bear or some shit. I don't know. The bear is holding something, it looks like an old tarp. It's still dry, for now. The bear walks up to me and puts the tarp over me. I feel something warm on my fingers and look down. A coyote is licking my fingers and I can't help but smile a little bit. A raccoon waddles over to me, holding up an apple like it's the Olympic Torch. He hands me the apple and flashes me a sneaky grin. I don't know how a raccoon got an apple this clean. I bite into the apple and realize that the animals are all looking at me. Almost like they're waiting for me to do something. I swallow the bits of apple in my mouth. I rearrange the tarp a bit to try to cover them up a bit, and we all huddle together. The bear's fur is warm and soft. The storm rages outside, but I'm dry, and I feel safe. And I realize this is what it's like. To feel like you're home. To feel safe. While the chaotic world rages around you, you're wrapped up and warm. Maybe I'm not meant to have a soulmate. Maybe I don't need one.", "As someone going through a breakup, this made me cry. Thank you, probably more than I will ever be capable of expressing.

However, Niara decided to accentuate her sisterly concern with the way she handled this final act of loving bedside manner, post-haste.", "Tyver made small choking noises as he tried to hold in a yell. The pent-up air was released as a very loud groan.

Home.\u201d", "They walked briskly in the cool air. They had been able to get an apartment not too far from their university\u2019s campus, but in the big city everywhere that you really wanted to go was of course nowhere near where you could find the best place. Tyver walked beside his sister, half following her and half spacing out. He did get what he was after. A few seconds of contact with the big cat. All things considered, he learned the lesson that shifting one\u2019s hands and feet into that of a cat does not negate the weight of a more or less average adult human male. If anything, it just made him an easier target while he pranced along thinking he was sneaky. The cartoon reels with the cat sticking the tiny canary into its mouth in the span of a breath flashed through his mind. It was kind of the same feeling of what happened in there.", "He stopped.", "He didn\u2019t say that. It was in his head. Telepaths were banned from urban areas, except the federal lawman types.", " ", "\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Tyver and the clear bell in his mind said at the same time. He started to look around. Someone here did that. He didn\u2019t know, but, maybe if he looked around. They had to be as confused as he was. Over there? No, there!", "\u201cTyver, what are you-\u201c", "\u201cShh! Shhhh. Something.\u201d He cast his eyes about. He used his ability to alter his eyesight, the traits to better see in the cheap streetlamp-lit street. There was almost a song echoing in his head. A slow, sad note that waved and flowed. It was getting even more slow, quieter.", "\u201cWait, don\u2019t go!\u201d he shouted with hands over his mouth to help amplify. Niara took a step back, blinking.", "Then, across the street. There she was. He could make out her silhouette, colors splotchy while his eyes kept shifting around between the various animals in his repertoire. He blinked rapidly, clearing the shift as best he could, then looking back toward the girl. She was making her way to his side of the street. The lady in his mind was as perplexed as he was.", "\u201cTyver, what is going on?\u201d Niara asked. A few other people on the avenue who were attracted by the brief show gradually went back about their business when the odd spectacle of a college kid twisting his head this way and that ended. They probably thought it was a drug trip gone bad.", "\u201cUhm. Excuse me?\u201d ", " Tyver responded with his thoughts, turning to face her. \u201cThis is weird. Are you a teep?\u201d", "\u201cOh god no, not a telepath, just, well, sort of. It\u2019s not on the No-Fly list.\u201d ", "She was pretty. Immediately she blushed, muted olive skin trying to morph into a strawberry. Wait, could she read his thoughts right now?", "\u201cThank you,\u201d she mumbled, clutching the book she was carrying to her hoodie.", "\u201cWait, no one said anything. Ty, what-\u201c Niara began, but then realized what was happening. This chick her brother just made a sudden connection with was slipping in and out of thought speech.

Both of you, shut the fuck up and come on, we are going home right now!\u201d", "\u201cHey babe, glad you\u2019re home!\u201d Alexander greeted the party when they piled into their apartment. \u201cI see you found delinquent number one, but, oh hoh hoh, who is this? Number one\u2019s new sidekick he\u2019s never told us about?\u201d", "Niara embraced her mate, the sparks of her power flying here and there with the temperature getting a little hotter. His own power, a fine mist with a lightish blue mist that brought chills down Tyver\u2019s back every time he was around it, phased into existence. When they touched each other, both of their manifestations of power turned into a warm white glow.", "\u201cShut up and go make some cookies,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd I dunno.

One day, you\u2019ve got to tell me how you do it!\u201d", "I always smile, and try to laugh it off.

I tell it through a hundred ways \u2013 the sound of the front door as it creaks shut, signalling the end of the workday. Or the sizzling of oil from the chopshop two doors down, as the chefs fry dinner for the workmen returning from the mines. Or even, if the day is especially quiet, the sound of the crickets as they rouse from their daytime slumber, eager to begin their nightly concerts.", "These are all sounds which Mr Jacobs, like everyone else, takes for granted. I don\u2019t have that luxury.", "He presses today\u2019s pay into my hands. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you more when business picks up,\u201d he says, patting my head, \u201cgod knows you\u2019re ten times more helpful than all the other crappy apprentices I've had. You deserve it!\u201d", "Mr Jacobs walks me to the door, though he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve never needed his help since the first day he\u2019s shown me around.

The insurance company had paid out handsomely, and the family was away this weekend, tending to his funeral in the next town, his birthplace.", "Which meant that his hut, in this town, would be empty tonight.", "Perfect.", "Home for me was a tiny attic I had rented in the local tavern. Rent was cheap, probably on account of my age, and you know, my infirmities. It was dark, stuffy, and during winters it really got quite unbearable. I lay on the mattress, conserving my energy for the night ahead, drifting in and out of a bland, dreamless sleep.", "When the sound of the main tavern door scraped across the floor, coupled with the crackling of the extra logs which the proprietor threw on the fireplace just before he retired for the night, I knew it was time, and I sprang out of bed, ready to go.", "Who needed clocks when habits helped people keep time so much better?", "Every gritty fault of the attic paled in comparison with the shining beacon of an advantage it offered \u2013 I could exit it at will without people knowing. The windowpane on the far side facing the street yawned open as I gently applied pressure. ", "My sling bag bounced against my back as my feet carried me pitter-patter across the rooftops. Learning this particular path had been difficult initially, especially since many of the tiles lay in disrepair. It had taken me the better part of the month before I had fixed up this passageway through the skies, gluing back loose tiles, straightening cornices, righting chimney-tops.", "I knew I had arrived when I heard the babbling of a nearby brook.

Satisfied, I felt my way over to the door, retrieved my trusty oil-bottle from my bag, then liberally bathed the hinges with lubricant. A set of self-fashioned lockpicks later, and I was in.", "Why steal, when I had a good, stable job? It wasn\u2019t the money, really. But the sense of thrill, of purpose... it was a drug I savoured, a freedom I could not possibly believe myself capable of experiencing. That first time I walked around in someone\u2019s home, I was unchained! Not merely just as able as my fellow man, but something more!", "The feather in my cap was figuring out that other people couldn\u2019t remember what they had if you simply tidied up everything for them. It sounds silly when you say it out loud, but it\u2019s true. Mrs Lamway, for example, hardly noticed her silver candelabra missing after she squandered all her attention at how clean and tidy her home had become. The others were the same.", "On my knees, feeling my way about, it became clear that the Stillerson family had left in a hurry.

He promised me that this time, he\u2019ll bring me out to town, show me around, help me remember my way around town!

So tell me, kid, will you recognise me on the street if I pass by you?\u201d", "The kid laughs, undeterred by the difficulties lying ahead. \u201cSure! I\u2019m actually quite good with faces! You\u2019ll just have to give me time!\u201d", "He cleans his hands hastily on his pants, then reaches out tentatively, confirming my suspicions.

I\u2019m much better than he is, with my years of practice.

", "\"I'm telling ya Jimmy it was them fairies everyone's talking about,\" Bill replied insistently, tugging at his beard before lifting his cigarette to his lips and sucking deeply the toxic fumes into his lungs, the smoke puffed out of him on a wheeze. Jimmy just shook his head as if he thought Bill daft, which he probably did. ", "Over the next few days more and more people started talking about the strange things happening in the middle of the night, creaky, broken and warped steps and porches magically fixed, leaky pipes mended, garage door openers which hadn't worked in months suddenly working again. In one memorable morning Juliane at number six woke up to find her half renovated kitchen completely finished. ", "The small town of Ballybrook was convinced they'd been blessed with a flock of handyman fairies. The fact that a watch here and there or some jewellery went missing at the same time, well it wasn't really worth mentioning. Things went missing all the time and besides the miraculous fixings happening all over town were much more interesting to talk about.", "\"Mama said it was da toof fairy,\" Lily Small a little girl of four with a couple missing teeth was heard telling everyone that would listen while out and about with her nan. ", "\"I heard Geoffrey said they painted his fence and weeded his garden,\" Paul said one evening at poker night, \"But I'm pretty sure it was just his son, you know Geoff, he'd forget his own head if it weren't screwed on,\" the others around the table mumbled and nodded in agreement, that sure sounded like Geoff. ", "The instances kept happening for weeks, then months then finally exactly a year to the date of the first reported fixing, they stopped. That day the whole town seemed to fall into hushed whispering darting furtive glances every which way as if waiting for something terrible to happen. So preoccupied with this impending sense of doom that not a single person noticed young Susie Jenkins leave town in her brand new Ferrari which everyone knew she couldn't afford, ready to hit the next town, and the next, and the next.

If this were a corny rags-to-riches autobio, I'd lie and tell you my first was a honey bun from a drugstore. Or maybe a loaf of bread for my sick mom or something like that. Well, don't get your hopes up; my mom was sick, but I'd have sooner stolen bread from her than for her.", "No, my first time was a pair of earrings. I watched Sarah put them in a box, then take the box upstairs, and I waited for her to come back down and kiss me goodnight. But after I left, I kept thinking about them, locked up safe, so treasured and protected. So I waited a week, then I went there while she was sleeping. I knew she had a creaky door, so I oiled it before jimmying the lock. The stairs squeaked on the way up, and I held my breath, feeling my blood pulsing loudly underneath. I went to her bedroom first. There she was, asleep and unaware. It took me five minutes to find the box, and ten more to find the key. Two days later, when I picked her up, I asked why she wasn't wearing the earrings I got her. My heart was pounding, I wanted to hear her say the word, wanted to feel the vulnerability in her voice. But she blushed, and told me she lost them.", "So I went back. I needed it--needed to. This time, I brought glue for her squeaky stairs. A bead between the riser and the step, wait ten minutes, then move up and do the next. After a couple of hours, I was done. This time I took money.", "She didn't even notice.", "I was frustrated. Felt like I bought a bag of bad drugs--I was scratching the itch, but it didn't do a damn thing. It was only when Sarah said \"it's so strange. I swear, my landlord is coming in when I'm out and not telling me. My stairs have stopped squeaking, and the front door too...\" I heard her uncertainty, her fear. Only then did I feel it again..the thrill.", "So I tested out my new drug. I broke into a new house that night. Dusted the cabinets so as not to leave fingerprints, then took a china figurine. Cleaned and organized the garage shelves, and pocketed a set of spark plugs. In the morning, I heard my boss pacing, on the phone with his wife, trying to explain that she must be mistaken, things didn't just clean themselves. The thrill was back in full force. You see, people lose things all the time. Entropy is easily blamed for larceny. But no one cleans houses by accident. When that happens, the fear comes in at full force. How did this happen? Was someone in here? Why did they do this? What else did they do?", "What else ", " they have done?", "I had found my new hobby. I stocked up on cleaning supplies, and began making my rounds that very night. I cleaned, I fixed, I organized, I rearranged. Sometimes, I left my supplies behind on purpose--a brush here, a can of Lysol there. Neighborhood newsletters began to circulate, warning people to change their locks (yeah, right) and leave their lights on (just made it easier for me to change the broken lightbulbs without attracting attention). I heard it in whispers, saw it in bemused looks, and I reveled in the power of knowing.", "I remember exactly when the tone changed. Mr. Falk, down at the grocery store, was telling people he would start leaving cookies out for the \"fixer fairy.\" Old fart--I wish I'd taken more than his watering can. It wasn't his fault, though...I suppose people can't live in fear for long. We're docile cattle at heart. When we can't do anything, we accept what's being done to us. We laugh in the face of fear just so we can feel there's nothing to be afraid of. ", "Just like that, the thrill was gone. My nightly endeavors became every-other-night-endeavors, then weekly endeavors. I no longer heard fear in muttered whispers, I heard casual laughter and superstition. I did even find cookies at one house. I left them out, but covered them with Lysol. I was becoming frustrated again. It didn't matter whether I stole six hundred dollars in cash or fixed the dent in their washing machine, I was simply a part of the landscape. I felt like I was gasping for breath every damn day, receding further and further into a deep depression. ", "It was months before the new opportunity presented itself. This time, it was nothing I'd done, nothing I'd come across, it was a simple thought in the shower. Quick and easy as a needle through skin.", "Tonight, I'm going out again. I feel excited at the prospect. God, it feels like years since I've been this excited! I'm bringing some of my cleaning supplies, but really just the necessary ones--bleach, scrub brush, microfiber cloth for fingerprints. And the Wusthof kitchen knife I took from Mrs. Carpinski, tucked safely in my thigh sheath. That thrill is back again...and this time, I don't think it will go away.", "\"...can\"t seem to find my pearl necklace anywhere, Julia!\" ", "My interest piqued, I glanced over my shoulder, and happened to see a recent victim walking out of the caf\u00e9 whose patio I just happened to be relaxing on. I turned back to my phone, hoping the two women would continue past me, but they were too busy talking to each other to notice me as they took the table a few rows past where I was sitting.", "The other woman, Julia, emitted a heavy groan as she sat heavily in the chair, looked like she had a hangover. Probably, as I had drugged her drink the night before when she had been out. Her eighth drink, to be precise. I probably hadn't needed to, considering she had been spinning at her fourth, but in all things, caution. In life, in work,and in relaxation.", "\"I don't know Mary, you probably lost it at that party where Matt had his grubby hands on you for half the night.\"", "\"Hmmm, Matt might be slimy, but a thief? I think he deserves a little more credit than that, Julie.\"", "An interruption by a quiet voice broke off the conversation as a waitress arrived to take the women's order.", "I opened my eyes and was getting ready to leave when the conversation started up again, and I hated to leave a good conversation about myself. After all, the best thieves are ones that you don't even know robbed you.", "\"...find it eventually, probably in one of your thousand jewelry cases.\"", "Well, make that 998.", "\"Maybe it was my landlord, I've been complaining about the door and the floorboards squeakin all the time and now all of a sudden they don't squeak anymore. But he says he hasnt been in the room or done anything!\"", "\"Huh, now that you mention it, Mary, my bedroom door didnt creak this morning, and the floor didnt have that sticky spot from where I dropped my waffles a week ago.\"", "\"Maybe Tommy cleaned it while you were drunk last night?\"", "\"Tommy, clean anything? Yeah right, maybe some reject god of cleaning mopped my floor last night and oiled the door hinges, he also got you hinges and nabbed the necklace as a fee!\"", "Both women giggled at the thought as I gathered my stuff and took my receipt to the cashier. It was time to move towns, to change hunting grounds.", "Todays meal was paid for with Mary's pearl necklace, among other things, and Julia's previous wedding ring, also among other things.", "My name is James, thief extrodinaire and apperant disgruntled reject god of cleaning.", "Authors Note: This is my first time doing this, so some constructive criticism would be appreciated by all my fellow writers out there!", "It became easier and easier for me. I expected the opposite. ", "Nevertheless, I found gates unlocked, dogs chained up, and even alarm systems neglectfully nonworking. The city had let its guard down for whatever fortunate reason, and burglary became my full time job.", "I was humble at first, but with the sheer number of houses I'd hit with not an iota of suspicion having arisen, it was tough not to laud myself as something of a mastermind; up in the ranks with the likes of Al Capone and Jesse James. ", "I stole just below a noticeable loot each time, and covered my tracks down to the last speck of foreign dust. As a matter of fact, I usually left the house in much better shape than I invaded it in.", "This was the key I think. People mistook robbery for charity. The city was in revelry. Crime was reported at record lows. Haven seekers inundated the city. Newspapers wrote of a mysterious public servant. Citizens misunderstood it as a pro bono initiative and they lent themselves to this non-existent cause. Streets were cleaned and programs and charities started. Everyone pitched in to make the city a better place. ", "They thought me their beacon of kindness and progress. In reality I was the city's greatest criminal. ", "I played along with the charitable movement, and even set myself apart in 'good works' to ever ease suspicion of future thievery. I opened an orphanage. I joined PACs, I aided in catching other criminals, and now I find myself behind the mayor's desk after all these years of getting away with robbery.", "The fools. If only they knew their mayor was a low-down scheming malefactor. They've made it too easy. I don't even need to steal anymore. As long as this city remains a safe, happy haven of peace and justice, they're all putty in my hands.", "One of the things they don't tell you about prison is the shocking lack of entertainment options. I'd read all the fiction the library had to offer, and found myself stuck with nonfiction. I learned that evidently Home Depot wrote books now. And HGTV is the only channel that comes in on the old TV.", "Tonight I'm glad for it, as I take a cautious step forward, easing my weight down. Yeah, this wouldn't do. A little talcum would stop the floor boards from squeaking. That left a mess, though. I swept it up, but a clean patch of floor was inconspicuous by itself. Had to sweep the whole floor. This place needed it too.", "It was my second conviction for petty theft, I'd been warned to straighten out or they'd throw the book at me. I tried. I looked for a job, but I didn't have much for skills and I had a record. It was back to my old ways. Old ways, new techniques.", "I emptied the dust pan into the trash can. That wouldn't do. Dust on top of a milk carton? A red flag. With practiced hands I tied the bag and replaced it, hurrying to the cans in the garage to deposit the trash.", "I thanked God and Bob Villa when I spotted the black widow, hiding under the hand rail of the step that led back into the house. A small smear and she was in spider hell.", "I managed to lift some change from the couch, and made my way up stairs. A squeaky step. No good, I'd be heard. It had to be fixed. It had to be fixed now.", "I took out my drill and grabbed a.. shit. How was I out of carpet screws? Nope, couldn't go on.", "As I made my way back to the house from Dale's 24/7 hardware, I thought back to my first days out. It had been rough, but I knew what I'd had to do. I had to muffle my drill, practice with the hammer until I could drive a nail without a sound or an elephant track in one swing. I could replace carpet, paint a floor, mop, sweep, wash dishes, replace a broken window, caulk a sink, hang a door... all of it in total silence. I wouldn't be caught. I couldn't be caught. I couldn't afford it.", "Back at last, I screwed down the carpet, stopped the floor from squeaking when I heard something from upstairs. The telltale flush. The flick of a light switch, the swing of a hinge. I held my breath.", "A child, maybe 9 rubbed her eyes and happened to glance at me. She covered her mouth the asked in a whisper, \"are you the house fairy?\"", "Stunned, I looked at myself, illuminated by the light on my drill. Black clothes and gloves, harness, tool belt, hundreds of little pockets. \"Uh... yep.\"", "\"I thought you'd be prettier. Could you fix my fan? It won't turn on, even when I pull the chain.\"", "\"Uh, yeah. No problem.\"", "Well, it's obvious that I'm going to have to relocate. Everybody has caught on to my tactics. Just about every home in town has a cheap safe bolted to the floor. That's not the worst part though, it seems as if people find my burglary skills to be more of a blessing than a threat.", "Some of the smart asses have begun leaving their doors unlocked with a God damn wish list of chores to be done on the door. Fuck them. Who do they think they're dealing with here? One of the jackasses even asked me to let their dog out so that he wouldn't wake them up early in the morning. Sure enough, the dog didn't even bark! He wagged his tail at me, so I just had to let him out. ", "Then, just last night, I walked into this one house (doors unlocked) and there was actually cleaning supplies and a note requesting that I get the fucking soap scum out of the shower. Assholes. I think that the \"wet bandits\" may have been on to something. At least they had some \"street cred.\" ", "\"Bob! Wake up, i think we've been robbed.\"\nBob's eyes sprang open and he combat rolled out of bed, ready to defend his homestead. He wasn't a particularly sporty guy, there was no baseball bat or golf club handy to use as a weapon, so he had to settle for his longest, sharpest model railway train. He brandished it like nun-chucks as he sprinted down the stairs. ", "He found his wife stood in the center of the living room weeping. The poor thing was in shock at the sight before their eyes. They could see the floorboards. They were brown, a fact he only vaguely recalled from when they had moved in 3 years ago. Bob shouted, \"What kind of animal steals toys?\" \n\"What are we going to tell the children?\"\n\"We'll worry about that later, we should see what else is missing.\" Bob put his precious train down on the table when something caught his eye, \"What is that box in the corner? I've never seen that before.\"\nHis wife wiped the tears from her eyes and scanned the room, \"I think that's the toy bin that we got the kids last year.\"\n\"Has it always been there?\"\n\"Yes, it was just buried under the mountain of stuffed animals and half eaten cheerios.\" \nBob stalked over, preparing himself for more anger. He pulled open the lid and shouted, \"Jane, you've got to see this.\"\nJane joined him and gasped, \"Wait, I think everything is in here? How? Did you hire a cleaner?\"\n\"Not after the last one stormed out of here. Whoever did this even colour coordinated the stuffed animals. Who does that? Should I call the Police?\"\nJane took a deep breath, \"And tell them what, someone broke in and stole the mess from our living room?\" \n\"We must be missing something. Perhaps this is a distraction. Check the computer!\"\n She rushed over and opened her laptop, \"Oh my goodness, you're right! All the files on my desktop are missing. Oh, wait, never mind, he's put in a file structure. Wow, this is much easier to find things.\"\n\"This could be one of those cyber crimes. He could have stolen my identity!\"\nAt that moment the phone rang. Bob yanked it off the receiver, \"Hello.\"\n\"Hello, is that Mr. Smith? I want to talk to you about the unusual activity on your account last night.\"\nBob cupped his hand over the receiver and shouted to Jane, \"Aha! I knew it!\"\nHe listened again as the bank teller continued, \"I want to assure you that the staff member responsible has been terminated and full charges will be pressed. We'd have never caught him either if it wasn't for that considerable reorganization of your accounts that highlighted the fraudulent fees. We would like to offer you a sizable reward as our way of saying thank you.\"\nJane was waving at him frantically so he said, \"I'm sorry, I'll have to call you back.\" He hung up and said, \"is everything alright?\"\nJane sobbed as she spoke, \"I found out what he took. Crackers the parrot is gone!\"\nBob's jaw fell open. The thief had cleaned up the living room, earned him money and now had stolen the miserable sack of feathers his wife fawned over instead of him. He tried to keep the smile off his face as he said, \"\"This guy better hope I never track him down!\"", "I stopped taking possessions years ago. Thats just incovienent for everyone. I have to go hawk the item, they have to rebuy it, its just a mess. Plus its more to carry, do you know how big my fixit bag is? Well you don't, im not doing my job if youve seen it.\nNo, I only take money now. And nudes. If someone leaves decent nudes out, I take them. Digital, print, whichever. I had one guy try to leave me a blockbuster gift card. I almost took it for nostalgia, but I didnt want rumors to spread that id take expired  or defunct currency. I mean, guys gotta eat.\nIve gotten word from a few sites that news outlets would pay good money to hear my story, but I figure reddit is where my people reside, so I'm putting it here for you.\nIt started because I needed money. You thought itd be more rich, more noble, maybe more interesting? The economy tanked, i lost my job, rent was due, i stole. But I had to sell my car so i couldn't get far, and i felt bad stealing from my neighbors, so Id fix stuff. I considered it an even trade. \nIt got weird when the police reports and newscasts stopped reporting it.\nIt got weirder when a subreddit and craiglist adds and facebook recommendations and yelp reviews started coming in. One guy gave me one star because I didnt fix his dryer. I didnt have the parts, man!\nThen the news came back around and the people they interviewed didnt even feel violated, they just figured it was a service like Uber or something, overnight repair man. \nSo now I run a small, technically criminal empire. I mean, why work alone? Ive got a few people under my employ, we take tax free money and we fix things. Ive fired a few people for stealing more thans fair, and Ive hired some uniqur folks.  Weve got an app coming.  Police, you ask? Half the cops in town use our services. Helps them get more done around the house. So next time something breaks, think of us! Everyone else does!   ", "\"That will do.\" Joseph said to himself as he carefully slid the broom back between the wall and the refrigerator where he'd found it several minutes prior. This was his last stop for the night before he was heading back out into the freezing temperature to make his way back to his own apartment. He'd made this stop to 320 Walton Ct only a few times this month, but it was an easy hit and he judging by the stories the folks here were telling other people around town, this wouldn't be the last time he'd make this stop. In fact, because of those stories about some selfless fairy fixing other people's houses, he figured if he worked a little extra at cleaning the place up after he'd done his job, he might just be able to make it a little more worth his while.

As he stepped in, his foot slipped and he clumsily fell face first into the truck, spewing coins, bills, a watch and old leather wallet all over the cab. He grabbed tonight's collection, removed the plastic bags from around his feet, and started the truck. As he drove out of Walton Ct and down Walton Rd he counted out loud the houses that he had hit in the past month. \n\"1, 2, 3...\" He laughed as he lit a cigarette. \"That one twice so that makes 5, just on this street alone.\" ", "A fuzzy old voice picked up in response, the radio. \"The kids are expecting Santa, while parents are expecting Bridgetown's Fairy. Rumor has it, he has his own list that he'll be checking once or twice, weather or not your naughty or nice!\"\n\"That's got a nice ring to it.

He made himself a cup of coffee, followed that one up with two more as he grabbed his pack of Marlboro's, a newspaper, a paper and a pen. His morning routine. He enjoyed the articles about the Bridgetown Fairy, a magical little creature that goes around fixing houses, cleaning, what have you. His favorite part was the lack of concern people had over things coming up missing. \"Nobody seems to notice the old stuff gone when the new stuff's fixed.\" He said to Jax, his dog. Jax lifted his head for a moment of acknowledgement, and rested it down when he realized there was no food following his master's voice. ", "He began making a list of houses that he'd already hit that week and weeks prior, and tallied the amount of times he'd been to each one. Some were becoming a little too frequent, so this week he was deciding to find a new location. Slums? Too easy, not enough reward, too much to fix. Ritzy? A lot of reward, not enough to fix, they'll notice. Middle class was his easiest target. He decided on a 10 year old subdivision on the other side of town. He'd only been in the area once, hit a couple houses, but had a bad vibe about it. But it was his best bet. He grunted as he made his way to the shower. He shaved his face clean, got dressed, and headed down to the market. ", "\"Good morning Joseph.\" Came a familiar voice. Mourna. She was as pleasant a woman as she was a wife.

She doesn't sense his urge to breakdown every time he sees her or hears her voice. ", "\"Good morning Mourna. Just the usual and this, he said as he set his milk and coffee beans on the counter top.

Yeah I've heard of it, I guess I didn't make the cut. Hasn't been around my place.\" \n\"Same here\" she said. Though Joseph knew that wasn't true. He'd been there, just a few nights ago, nothing weird about it. He just knew it would be an easy enough hit, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. What kind of man would steal from a woman already down, someone he actually still believed he loved. She looked at him crookedly, sensed something was up. \n\"Maybe you'll get lucky.\" He winked.\n\"I'd rather not, I don't buy into the fantastical thought of some make believe fairy fixing my place up. There's obviously more to it than that, some creep staking the town out.\"", "She always had some sense. Not like these other fools with loose screws in their heads. A fairy? I mean common. \"Hey listen, it was good to see you again, Mourna.\"\n\"You too Joseph.\" She shot him a look that reminded him of the old days where he knew he was on the only guy getting that innocent look of compassion. \"Take care.\"", "That night he did his usual thing. Got his gear together, hopped in the truck and made for Bridge Grove, the small subdivision. He'd eyed a good looking home last time he was here. A mid sized home, comfortable looking. He found it toward the front entrance of the subdivision. 305 Newfrost Ln. He made his way around to the side. The idiot left his cellar door open. Must be expected a small winged beastie. \"No such luck.\" He muttered and stepped down into the musky cold basement. He popped on a flashlight.", "What he noticed first sent a shiver up his spine and made him nearly lose consciousness. He flicked this light back off and stood there frozen for a few moments. He aimed the flashlight at the floor, turned it back on. Slowly, he aimed it straight ahead. He couldn't really believe what he'd just seen, but sure enough as he raised it, his fears became true. First he saw the feet, the legs, the lower body, torso, head. The head, what he'd initially seen, bullet hole and all. He jolted backward into the wall, actually a rack of some sort that rattled everything that hung from it. He turned to see, and noticed several different guns; rifles, pistols, semi-automatics... more than anyone truly needed. As he moved back toward the cellar door, he tripped over a box. Inspecting that he noticed a case of money. Thousands he guessed. He panicked, grabbed the case, and broke for the door, back around the house and froze. Considering his reputation, if he didn't follow suit now, he may never be able to make another hit in this town again. \"What the...?\" He thought and shook the idea clear, continuing his sprint to his truck. He tried starting it, but it was giving him some trouble. He tried again, no luck. He looked back to the house and saw the curtains shift, someone was in there. \"Common, common!\" He growled at the igniter. He peered over once more and saw the front door begin to open. \"COMMON!\" He screamed, and finally, it gave. He threw it into drive, and sped out of the subdivision.

As he sped, he came to a part where the road narrowed over a small bridge. He was going too fast for even a clear weather mid-noon day, only it was midnight and they had another forecasted snow storm. His back tire slipped out, he bumped the railing of the bridge, and hit hard into a small ditch. He was out cold. ", "The next morning, he woke up to a middle aged man knocking on his window. Everything was hazy, but he managed rolling the window down. He could feel the frozen blood irritating the bridge of his nose. \"Need help out of there buddy?\" A toe-truck driver. Thank God it wasn't whoever was in that house last night. The man helped him out of the ditch and noticed the bloodied case in the passenger seat. \"What's with that?\" The man said nodding toward it. ", "Joe saw the blood, is it mine? Or that man in the basement's? He touched his forehead remembering the blood. Put his hand out and shrugged, indicating he must have gotten his blood all over it. Thankfully it was closed, so the man didn't question and get suspicious about all the money inside of it. ", "He finally made it home after a long night. He'd wished the nightmare had ended there but he wasn't so lucky. His placed was completely and totally destroyed. His stuff was everywhere, turned upside down, broken. A complete and total disaster. The next two things he noticed was the lack of heavy animal attacking his leg. Jax wasn't here. He slammed his foot into a chair and sent it crashing into the dining room table where yesterday's coffee cup and newspaper still sat. Which is where he noticed the next thing, a note on the table. He read it.", "\"Dear Mr. Fairy,\nI believe you mistook that house last night as one that you could help yourself into and fix up. Maybe even steal a few bucks. Our little secret. But you took something of mine. I'm pretty disappointed in how you left the place. Such a mess. And the body in the basement. Despicable. I hope you can come to your senses.\nYou don't want to take the fall for this, and you want your dog back.

They had a little mutt that I was worried would bark at me, but he didn't seem to mind me. It turns out he was a scaredy cat type of dog who didn't bark much, but he had another defense. It only took me about 10 minutes to clean up the pee, and by that time I had scoped out the kitchen and laundry room, and noticed a wallet sitting on the counter. ", "I found about eighty bucks in there, and figured that would suffice. As I was leaving I noticed how terribly filthy my shoes were. I must have stepped in mud on my way in, so I tried to wipe it up with a rag I found but that just wasn't working out so I had to get  the mop. Then I left. Then I remembered all the dirty dishes in the sink. If I'm, well, stealing, (I hate to call it that) I guess I should do something to make up for it, so I went back in and did the dishes. And folded the laundry. Before I knew it I had waxed the stained concrete floors and disinfected the toilets. ", "I couldn't stop cleaning. Everything was so dirty, and I did take $80 so I had to do a lot of sweeping and wiping and polishing and dusting to make up for it. Before I knew it the sun began to rise. I didn't realize how long I had really been there, so I started frantically putting away the cleaning supplies when I accidentally dropped the windex. It wasn't that loud because it was just a plastic bottle, so I figured I would be okay. Then I started to hear footsteps. I was freaking out. What do I do? Where can I hide?

But don't get too worked up, you're setting a bad example for the kids\". I said. \"It's cold out mom, can we go back in now\"? Lil Jimmy asked. \"Sure, sure\". I replied, shooing them through the front door.", "The kids raced up stairs and jumped into their beds before the screen door could close behind us.

The door was so horribly made that even poking the thing would make the loudest creaking sound. I got the oil and fixed that up.", "The next issue was that Mr. Smith's fridge was awful, too. The food was barely cooled. No wonder he never touched the leftovers. I left momentarily and came back to replace the refrigerator with one I had stolen for Ms. Johnson two doors down.

The ground was infested with termites, eating picture frames. One of these victimized frames, I noticed, had a photograph of him with his wife, who had passed away last year. I knew Mr. Smith had been so hurt from losing her that he didn't speak to anyone for a month. So I started cleaning the whole garage out, getting rid of the termites. Finally, after I had carried out a few antiques, I took the portrait and hung it in the middle of his living room, above the fireplace.

I'll just pop out to see what it is, won't be a moment.\"", "She stepped out of the study and shut the door behind her gently before leaning back on it, taking a deep breath. She could feel the familiar weight of her mask clipped to her belt. It was designed to cover her whole face with dark, jagged crystals, all harsh lines and sharp edges, black ice as twisted and as dangerous as she was supposed to be. She put it on.", "Rime briskly made her way to the hero she'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in her hallway. She couldn't\u200b quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface, but the costume was gaudy, the colors garish. She couldn't help but sigh. An amateur, but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb her on Wednesdays.", "She snapped her fingers. ", "The cube melted in an instant, freezing water gushing across the floor, draining quietly through the numerous storm drains she'd had installed.

Newbies nowadays...", "\"Rime!\" the hero called - well, wheezed. \"I'm here to-\"", "\"Your name?\" Rime said. ", "\"Stop you- huh?\" the hero faltered. This close, their voice was young, high pitched, still slightly squeaky. \"My... what?\"", "\"Your. Name.\" Rime said, enunciating the words clearly. She gestured at the hero's bedraggled costume.", "The hero blinked up at her. \"I'm- I'm Phoenix.\"", "Rime rolled her eyes. Seriously? \"Let me guess. You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain, a superhero saved you, and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them?\"", "Rime waited a moment. It was only polite.", "When no response was forthcoming, she continued. \"Let's see if I'm on a lucky streak. Lo and behold, you're one of the lucky few that get usable powers, you realize you have a knack for fire, and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of me once and for all because I'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around, and fire, after all, completely negates ice? Or so you'd think, at least?\"", "\"Uh.\" said Phoenix.", "\"Did you listen at all during class? They teach you this on the first week.\"", "The blush was a dead giveaway.", "Rime sighed. \"Oh, dear. You went off to find me the moment you got your powers, didn't you? Did you have the costume ready made?\"", "It was disappointing. The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year. There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how-to guide on the internet.", "\"So, Phoenix,\" Rime continued. \"Usually, as retribution, I'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you're missing, but my afternoon is already fully booked. I need to deal with Ultraman's latest attempt to foil my plans. Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again.\"", "\"Ultraman?!\" Phoenix exclaimed, suddenly talkative once more. \"He's like... old, and washed up, and senile! He's not even part of the League anymore!\"", "Rime had to restrain herself from freezing Phoenix - oh, but how she hated that name - right then and there. \"He's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years,\" she said coldly, \"Which you would know if you actually went to class. And when the League decided he wasn't useful to them anymore, they discharged him without so much as a pension or even a thank you. Fifty years and it meant nothing to them. The League isn't government funded. It runs for profit, and at the end of the day, it cares about money. The League didn't much fancy taking care of an elderly, senile hero... so it let him go.\"", "Phoenix gaped at her. It only lasted for a moment. \"The League would never do something like that!\"", "\"Ask the League where Ultraman's pension is,\" Rime said. \"Or Wonderlady's, or Crowstorm's, or any of the older heroes for that matter. The League doesn't care. But we at the Confederation remember, and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation. The enemy of my enemy and all that, as they say, because the League most certainly hasn't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes. One might even say it's been quite villainous.\"", "\"You're lying!\" Phoenix cried out. \"The League wouldn't do that, and you're just saying it because you're, you're a villain! And evil!\"", "Rime had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation. \"If that helps you sleep at night, then by all means keep telling yourself that. Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge me on a Wednesday. Now get out of my lair before I decide I do actually have enough time to freeze you.\"", "A wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor, a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight.

That took a little longer than I expected...\" she trailed off, finding Ultraman asleep in his armchair.", "\"Huh?\" Ultraman grunted, rousing himself. \"Whassat?\"", "\"Nothing,\" Rime said. \"Sorry for waking you.\"", "\"You younglings nowadays, and your nothing.\" Ultraman grumbled. \"It's always nothing with you. Back in my day, we didn't sit around doing nothing, we found ourselves something to do.\"", "Rime smiled, turning away to hide it. \"I'm sure you did,\" she said. \"I'm sure you did.\"", "\"You kids nowadays have it so easy, sitting around all day. Back then, being a hero meant work! We had pride, a real pride in what we did, and...\"", "\"You sure we won't get in trouble?\" asked Kaaboom, nervously picking at his collar. \"I mean, I'm still on probation, you know. Can't afford to get written up on any more of them charges.\"", "\"There's no crime if it's for a good purpose,\" said Vorlax, who as No. 42 on the League's most wanted list, really was the last person anyone should be taking legal advice from. \"Besides, I'm the one with the dummy explosives here, so Chronotron's going to be focusing fully on me. You ready?\" ", "The two supervillains took a deep breath, then pushed their way to the centre of the crowded town square. Vorlax hopped onto a bench, threw open his trenchcoat, revealing a neat array of sausages, tightly wrapped in brown paper. The alarm clock which Kaaboom had helped tape to the front dangled precariously. ", "\"Screw all of you! Damn you all to hell! See ya all in the afterlife, muthaf-\"", "Vorlax never got to finish his threat. Even before the gathered crowd could react, even before the first screams could rend the air, he had already frozen in place, encased in a shimmering cage of writhing chrono-filaments.", "Hot damn, thought Kaaboom, so this is what it looks like from the outside. ", "Enthused clapping rang out as the citizenry acknowledged yet another successful rescue by the hero known as Chronotron, the League's newest poster boy. He hovered in the air, waving at his adoring fans. ", "\"Fear not, one and all, the threat has been neutralised! It's off to the gallows for this one!\"", "\"Wait, wait!\" shouted Kaaboom, remembering the part he had to play. They had flipped a coin for this, because it was never fun to have to explain to the League what they were really up to, plus it wasn't easy suppressing the instinct to run, an instinct they had honed their entire careers. \"Wait, Chronotron! I can explain everything!\" ", "The darkening scowl from Chronotron made it clear to Kaaboom that he had only a very short window of opportunity. ", "\"Kaaboom? You caught up in this terrorist attack too?\"", "\"No, no! Wait, I mean yes! But not in that way, those aren't explosives at all, I swear! Just sausages! From the deli opposite!\"", "Chronotron stretched a hand into the chronocage, poking tentatively. His scowl deepened as his finger pierced into the soft mushiness of a bratwurst. ", "\"If this is a joke, Kaaboom, it is in bad taste. Causing undue public alarm is also a crime!\"", "\"We needed to get to you urgently, that's all! And the League wouldn't take any of our calls, our numbers are all blacklisted! Please, just a minute of your time, in private!\"", "Chronotron snapped his fingers, and a larger chronocage extended to envelop the two of them. Outside the bubble, the world ground to a halt. ", "\"55 seconds remain, Kaaboom, before I'm hauling both you and Vorlax in.\"", "\"Right, right! See, we think something's happened to Vortex Man, and just in case he needs help urgently, we thought, you know, your powers would come in handy! I swear, that's the truth!\" ", "A puzzled frown spread across Chronotron's face. \"Vortex Man? Why would anything happen to him? He's been retired for years!\"", "\"Well, see... There's this roster we have, all the ones who have been given second chances by him before. We take turns to check in on him, just to make sure the old boy's getting on well...\"", "\"How would you know where he lives anyway? His identity's still a secret!\"", "Kaaboom thrust a sheaf of papers at Chronotron, and said, \"We don't, but look, we know his routine, where he goes for his daily walk, where he gets his coffee... And we take turns staging kidnappings, or hold ups, just so that he has a bit of exercise, you know? We think it keeps him happy, being relevant and appreciated and all...\"", "The first time he had been asked to assist, Kaaboom had drawn the short straw, so the role of a desperate mugger went to him. He had come away from the encounter shaken, not so much because Vortex Man still packed a mean punch, but because he had truly aged, now a mere shadow of the strapping superhero who had first apprehended Kaaboom on the streets so many years ago.", "The sheen to Vortex Man's once thick, lustrous hair was gone, and a certain pallidness clung to his skin like shame to an introvert. His mind too, frail and feeble, couldn't recognise Kaaboom even though he played a kidnapper, then a rapist, then a mugger again, three days in a row. ", "Heck, Kaaboom even had to pretend to be a cat in a tree once, after Vorlax suggested that variety would help keep Vortex Man nimble.", "Kaaboom didn't mind helping out more, especially after the other supervillains started excusing themselves from the roster, citing the poor economy, the need to find work in other cities, family commitments... there were fewer and fewer of them on the roster, which meant that some weeks, Kaaboom and Vorlax did double, triple duties.", "After all, the way that Vortex Man brightened up every time he helped someone... that was enough for Kaaboom to want to come back again, the very next day.", "Chronotron flipped through the papers, understanding slowly dawning on him. \"And I take it, he hasn't turned up today?\" ", "\"Yes, you get it now! Nothing! We've been on Evil.net, and no one else has seen or heard from him in two days! So we thought, he's been pretty regular with his schedule, and for him to suddenly not turn up...\"", "If there was one thing Kaaboom had to give Chronotron credit for, it was that he truly had the gumption and decisiveness of a first-class hero. Chronotron handed back the papers, raised both arms in the sky, and shouted as the chronocage grew, slowly at first, then faster, and larger, till it stretched further than the eye could see. ", "Now, nothing moved, except for the two of them. ", "\"Come, then, let's go. I have a rough idea of where he stays. If there is any medical emergency, this should buy us some time till we can get help to him.\"", "\"Err... Chronotron, if you don't mind, could we get Vorlax to come too? This was his idea after all...\"", "Chronotron laughed, then inclined his head ever so slightly. ", "\"... uckas!\"", " is up!

This is an insult to my  standing as a board member.\"", "One of the trio, a muscle bound young blonde man wearing little more than bearskin underwear turned to the captain. The hint of a sneer played about his face. \"You aren't a board member anymore, Mr. Kaiser.\"", "\"That's CAPTAIN Kaiser to you, sonny!\" the elderly hero extended himself to his full height, and felt a twinge in his back. He fought to hide the pain and to keep himself ramrod straight before the indignant youth. Even so he barely came up to the nearly-naked man's Adam's apple. ", "\"Fine, Captain. Whatever. The fact is you are no longer in the League and have no business doing hero work. Further, if you are so capable, why is it this scene was here for us to arrive to?\"He gestured about himself.\"", "Austr\u014d stood watching the encounter since the mighty boom crashed down from the sky to reverberate off the mansion walls.

This geezer has nothing to do with us. Pay him no mind.\" ", "Austr\u014d grinned. \"I don't think  I should pay any of you any mind.\" She turned and grabbed the nearest base human, ripped an emerald necklace from her throat.

She came from inside a few moment later carrying two lemonades. Hans looked at her with confusion a moment before recalling that she'd been with him over an hour, and had only stepped away to get them drinks. \"Thank you my little spring dawn.\" That had been his pet name for his daughter since she was born with the sunrise one beautiful May morning.

Keep. Robbing. Banks.\" With that, Peacekeeper slumped to the ground.", "Harpy's reaction was instant. She dropped the guard (who let out a heavy gasp) and sprinted towards the downed hero. Harpy checked for a pulse before putting her ear to the hero's chest.", "Stop fussing,\" muttered Peacekeeper, his breath shallow. \"Just need to take my medication. It's in my front pocket, can't seem to find it though...\"", "Harpy reached behind the elderly hero and produced a small brown bottle. Upon consuming a couple of pills, Peacekeeper's breathing returned to normal and Harpy's concern began to fade, just enough for her to get angry.", "\"I can't believe they let you through the cordon!\" she said. \"What the hell were they thinking!

Shade smiled watching this old man scarf down the gummies like an adolescent.", "\"It's okay I hope they understand it's part of the job some da- WAIT! No! No! No! We're talking about you young man now you have to promise!\" Neroman said his hands beginning to glow.", "\"Put those away Neroman I promise to TRY okay?\" Shade responded his hands up in surrender. They continued walking Neroman walked faster increasing his speed until he was in front of shade walking more dramatic as his towel turned cape blew in the wind. Neroman was escorting Shade to the local precinct after catching him in the dastardly act of J-walking. It must've been an odd sight Shade was easily taller than the old man, and with his reputation he could snap him in half with no effort. Shade's soulless eyes would usually be sucking the hope out of all around him his ethereal mass less shadow head floating on a disconnected cape. However, Shade didn't mind letting this old man and his makeshift cape escort his nightmarish form to a police station. ", "\"Shade you dastardly, disgusting, deviant!\" A small man yelled from behind him.", "\"That can't be grammatically correct\" Shade spoke sarcastically the darkness in his hand returning, burning like the fires of hell ready to snap the upstarts neck. ", "\"I am PlastoMan, and I-\" PlastoMan started before Neroman ran in front of Shade. \"I've got him fellow Hero don't worry I'll make sure he gets to the proper authorities\" Neroman stated proudly. \"Hero's never change always showing off\" Shade thought staring fondly at Neroman. ", "\"Move Gramps let the real heroes fight crime okay?\" PlastoMan pushed Neroman. Neroman began to trip before he could touch the ground Shade had caught him helping him up. Plastoman's body had been flung into a near by building both legs shattered. Neroman looked up into Shade's eyes almost embarrassed and, Shade knew the walk was over.", "\"Oh thank you sir! Must've tripped, You must be one of those new heroes that I hear about!\" Neroman responded, his hero persona dropping out of him as his mind snapping to another personality almost instantly. The doctor had said something about this happening if Norman kept heroing about. Almost like his mind would shut off his hero persona if it felt his pride was being threatened, like a ego shield.", "\"No, Nero- I mean Yes, Norman I am\"  Shade hated moments like these. Norman would be here then gone in an instant, with no one knowing for how long. The old man seemingly lost in his own mind like a hamster in a maze. Cerberus had told him about this to take it easy on him and to cherish what was there. ", "\"I have a son like you, you know? Costume like yours and everything except you know less menacing\" Norman said almost nervous-like. ", "\"Yeah my old man has been telling me I should try warmer colors\" Shade responded. ", "\"Good advice sounds like a swell guy, HAHAHA\" Norman laughed.\"...I hope he's doing okay though he doesn't come to see me. I don't blame him it'd break his heart, flaws of a hero right? Care way too much...\" Norman continued walking forward. Shade walking next to him listening silently. ", "\"Can I bother you for the time young sir? I need to be at the hospital at 6:30 my wife was supposed to take me but, I think I walked off without her! HAHAHA\" Norman spoke chuckling. \"Come to think about it where am I going?\" Norman seemed confused looking around. ", "\"We were going to Metropolitan on 6th, you asked me to walk you there\" Shade responded pulling out his arm from underneath the cloak checking his watch. \"..and you've got time it's 5:47\"", "\"I did? Oh, your right I did! Well I'm sorry my stories I must've gotten us lost\" Norman said drooping his head like a sad puppy. ", "\"It's okay Norman looking at the signs we should only be a block or two away\" Shade spoke truthfully. Norman immediately perked up happy to know he hadn't wasted a strangers time. The two continued chatting, walking towards the hospital like comrades in arms. Turning the corner they saw a concerned looking woman, her pudgy round frame tucked into a pink sweater and mom jeans standing in front of the hospital. ", "\"There's my firecracker she's gonna beat me silly HAHA!\" Norman laughed staring fondly at his wife. \"Norman?\" His wife responded almost tentatively turning to her husband. \"Of course, sugarbug who else looks this good in a towel?!\" Norman responded hugging her. His wife hugged him back tightly, happy that she wouldn't have to talk Neroman down and into the hospital. She stared at Shade standing off to the side just out of arm's length, but to her seeming miles away. ", "\"Thank you, And- I mean Shade for walking this headache back here.\" She said holding Norman's hand. Shade nodded preparing to warp away until Norman stopped him. \"Hey Shade was it?\" Norman spoke to Shade like an old friend he was seeing for the first time in awhile. \"Thank you for walking me here, I just wanted to ask that if you see my kid out there tell him to come by, I'd like that\" Norman spoke a slight tinge of sadness in his voice. ", "\"Sure old man what's his name? Hero I mean of course can't go yelling his identity all over the city! HA- um sorry....\" Shade said swallowing the laughter. Norman's face lit up his wife staring at shade with eye's that dripped compassion, Shade wouldn't look at her, not anymore.", "\"It's fine! He goes by Shadowman, Moon Warrior, or something dark and forbidding like that.\" Norman's scattered mind tried to pull the old memory forward. Flashes of memories whipped past him like a train he needed to catch but, wouldn't slow for him. His son's powers manifesting, the accident that made him use them in public becoming a hero, Christmas a purple bow on a dark box, a young man crying near his bedside, fire cooking his flesh....", "\"It's okay Norman I think I know a guy who could help me find him\" Shade broke his thought process seeing the memories almost breaking the old man. \"Focus on your wife and getting better I'll tell your son you miss him.\" Shade waved them away Norman and his wife walking through the doors of the hospital. Shade sighed before disappearing he didn't need another hero running at him in front of the hospital.", "Edit: Thanks for the editing advice guys I'll try and clean it up my grammar was never good, as you can probably tell", "Edit 2: MY FIRST REDDIT GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He had been saving his neighbours kid from the local bullies. After that the mayor even made sure the league cleaned up the streets around Max's hood so he wouldn't miss an appointment.

By that stage I was running the show and dads powers were killing him. ", "Towards the end I told my dad I'd take Max out for him as one last gotcha.  He said \"We don't kill family\".

Tired of it all, the same ole routine with the same ole villains.

His grin curved just a little more upwards as he felt her sparkling blue eyes turn on her and seem to grow wider at the sight of him. Guardian knew it was fear of who was there, the city's epitome of hero's. He was tall and muscular, filling out his suit like a glove of pure muscle, his perfectly quaffed brown hair almost always seemed to blow lightly in that mysterious breeze that seemed to surround all his dramatic entries...

Now he was nothing more than a bag of bones and skin, a shell of the former hero and pride of the City.", "No Guardian was gone, and in his stead was simply a man that was to far gone in his own mind with past glories that he would make him run headlong into the middle of a lightning storm with no real way of winning.

To us, however, he was a milestone in all of our lives. My father,  Mega-Kill Sr., was his arch nemesis for decades. I remember when I was 17 or 16, my pops gave me his suit. He said to me; \"Georgie,  if you want to be a real villain,  you gotta know how to fight a super.\" So with me wearing the mega-elector suit  (which was about 3 sizes to big) and a death blaster, I made my way to mainstreet during the lunch or dinner  hour, but i'm not sure what time it was, it would be around 30  years ago. So I raise the death blaster, I aimed it at something like a mail box or a fire hydrant, or something, and before I could even press the trigger,  there he was. Maximum Justice; Head founder of the Justice Unit. He appeared right next to me and crushed the gun's barell between 2 of his fingers. I went into punch him, crashed my fist straight on his nose. Broke my hand for 4 months. He didn't hit me back, god knows I deserved it though. I was just a punk trying to be like his punk father. Looking back, I think Maximum Justice knew that. It wasn't just me though, all the members of the Tyranny Union  had parent super villians, whom most of us took our names from. 400 villains in the tyranny Union,  all of whom got their start with Maximum Justice. \nSomewhere over the years things began to change for Maximum. He got slower, weaker, older. Any Tyranny Union member could of killed him years ago, but none of us could. We had to much respect for the man who was a giant in this industry. The heroes, those jack ass', never understood that. That the man they would be little was the foundation of what they do. Oh it made me sick. During the usual street brawls, they would force Maximum Justice to stay in the car, like a kid or a dog. Treating him as an errand boy, giving him demeaning jobs to make him feel useful. Who makes Maximum Justice take out his dry cleaning and get his coffee? \nThe man is dead now. Died of a cardiac arrest in Justice Unit Headquarters. A warrior like him didn't deserve such a mediocre death. He should of died saving the planet, like he always invisioned. Sone people think that's why he stayed with the Justice Unit, so he could have the death he deserved, like his fallen comrades had. One died in an a alin attack, one died redirecting a nuke into space, the other died stopping the sun exploding. But Maximum Justice, the icon, the legend, dies because of a cardiac arrest? It's not fair.\nI arrived to his funeral out of costume, along with other Tyranny Union members. What we found was nothing less of disgusting. The Justice Unit had passed on the responsibility of planning his funeral, unlike what they had done for other members who received statues and magnificent pieces of art that honored them. All Maximum got was a small church, with only the Tyranny Union and an old Priest to pay final respect. The public itself completely disassociate itself with the great hero.

He actually managed to corner me once, twenty years ago. We was in a burning building, my boys had started the fire as a distraction, the place was supposed to be deserted, see. So anyways, we're in there, and we hear kids screaming. We both ran up there, grabbed two kids apiece and got them out, and ran back in for the last two.

Anyway, we rescue the kids, and I'm standing there panting, covered in soot, with a few bruises and burns, and he says to me: 'I always knew there was some good in you, now get out of here'. I owe him Harold. I built all of this on thirty years of crime, and I was good at it. I quit the bank robbing then, and have watched as new heroes keep showing up, and not showing Freedom the respect he deserves. For the last few years I've been staging little fake crimes around town to make sure Freedom still gets to stop me. Now he gets to catch me, I'll be dead soon and he won't remember who we were, this is important, we'd have been nothing, nothing I tell you, if it weren't for each other, and you wouldn't be here if we hadn't pulled you and your friends out of that building, so goddamit, you're gonna help!\"", "Inferno really didn't mind looking after the old bugger but the mornings were by far the thing I dreaded the most.

It was \u201cThe Great Fight\u201d not because they lost many comrades that day, and not because it was difficult experience, but because it was the most fun any of the villains had had since their innocence was stolen and they were forced into a life of crime.

Manman gave me my first scar.  Manman was the reason I was given each of my life sentences and Manman did it with style!  I was able to keep my pride intact when Manman allowed me to turn myself in!  He even cleaned me up and told me, \u2018Next time just believe in yourself and you\u2019ll accomplish things you\u2019ve only dreamed about!\u2019  And that was exactly what I needed to hear, because I was just about to take a job as a computer technician!\u201d  ", ", The Chameleon thought.

There was such passion in his words. A tear escaped the big man\u2019s eye, followed by another and another. Soon a steady stream of tears flowed down his cheeks as he ran a hand through his sparse, greying hair and let out an exasperated laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s all I know\u2026\u201d He cried. \u201cIt\u2019s all I know.\u201d", "Tempest frowned at the big man out of pity. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d he said, gesturing towards the broken relic of a man \u201cThis is why I fight.\u201d He walked over and slid down the wall to sit next to Captain Tomorrow. As the man wept next to him, Tempest pulled out a cigarette and lit it with a spark from his thumb. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at this for 50 years, started while you were just a kid. You got picked up by the Coalition of Defense and made a career out of stopping Villains who wanted to destroy the world or rule it. But as time went on, those Villains found other ways to make their mark. They traded in their capes and lairs for three-piece suits and skyscrapers. Turns out ruling the world or destroying it is a lot easier than anyone thought.\u201d He took a long drag of the cigarette and passed it to the old man who took it warily and began to smoke.", "\u201cSo why do you fight?\u201d The hulking figure asked, wiping the tears from his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You say that the villains are no more but you steal and destroy property, you cause mayhem. Why do you do it?\u201d", "Tempest sighed and looked at the ground. \u201cMy father taught me to stand up for what I thought was right. He said that sometimes people would try to tell me I was wrong but if I listened to my heart, I could never fail. Those villains he fought are running the show now. They\u2019re in the corps, the government, and the law enforcement. Even our once renowned heroes don\u2019t get the care and respect they deserve because those who could get it done don\u2019t care. Not all of them are corrupt but like I said, everything is grey now. It\u2019s hard to distinguish between the good and the bad.

They lack imagination.\"", "\"Ha!  Hahaha!  Follow your heart, Henry!\"", "Sure Captain Honor admitted the young heroes caught more criminals in quantity, but Captain Honor was adamant about beating them in quality. He caught more real super villains than anyone else. The real big names like DoubleShot, BadBaller, KingCruel were caught by none other than Captain Honor himself. And he did it with just his tried and true powers of enhanced strength and agility without the need for fancy new technology. Although, for some reason the criminals he caught seemed to be able to escape prison whenever they wanted.", "But one day the scariest most violent villain of them all, Sin, kidnapped the mayor of the city and after executing several prominent businessmen and politicians. Sin demanded chemicals and equipment which seemed to obviously be for weapons by the end of the day. The heroes guild only managed to recruit 3 super heroes in time to make a rescue attempt before Sin's ransom timer was up. Though the honorable captain was ready they didn't recruit him for the cause. Dishonored, the captain decided to force his way into the group.", "\"Why didn't you guys call me for help?\" he asked them. The 3 other heroes grew awkwardly silent until their leader, HellMan responded \"we didn't want to disturb your retirement\" to which Honor replied \"I'm not retired. I'll never retire.\" Hellman's patience ran out, though to be fair he was half demon and didn't have much to start with, and he said \"Look old man, you're just going to get in the way\". The Captain looked to the other two heroes and asked \"WaterGirl, SteelHawk, do you really agree with this guy?\" They looked away from him too bashful to say anything, but in obvious agreement with HellMan. \"I remember when these guys were just a bunch of kids trying to fit-in with the normals in school\" thought Honor. \"I'm coming whether you're greatfull for it or not\" said Captain Honor.", "The plan was ready, SteelHawk with his powersuit that gave him flight and advanced weaponry was going to surprise and distract them from above. WaterGirl was going to sneak by turning into water. After WaterGirl found the Mayor, HellMan was going to teleport to her and teleport the hostage out leaving WaterGirl and SteelHawk to escape on their own as HellMan could only teleport one other person per day. WaterGirl was immune to bullets and physical attacks as she was made of water, and SteelHawk was extremely agile in his flight suit so escaping without HellMan's help would be the easy part.", "Captain Honor, not included in their plan at all, decided he was going to fight his way to Sin and take the guy out directly. ", "The operation began with SteelHawk shooting rockets from very high in the air. WaterGirl sneaked in through the plumbing system until she made her way to the room with the Mayor. The plan was going well, they didn't fire any anti-air shots at SteelHawk and the room with the Mayor seemed unguarded. Meanwhile, Captain Honor sneaked his way in, beating up some dumb guards on the way. ", "WaterGirl ran up to the Mayor and freed him. He started to laugh. The Mayor ripped at his own hair. His head hair and beard came off, and underneath was the bald and clean shaven face of Sin himself. WaterGirl wished she had payed more attention to local politics so she could have recognized he wasn't the Mayor. Sin's laughing continued as he hit a button on a panel on his arm and the entire room burst out in electric shocks. WaterGirl screamed, as electricity was her weakness. She quickly lost consciousness. Sin on the other hand seemed to enjoy the pain from the electric shocks, as he was a bit of a masochist. Sin put his hand inside WaterGirl's liquid head and his hand started to heat up. It was so hot the room lit up in unbearable brightness. When the light dissipated WaterGirl's head was no more, and her body turned into regular lifeless water.", "\"WATERGIRL? WATERGIRL ARE YOU THERE? WATERGIRLLLL\" screamed HellMan unaware of her demise. Through the rashness of his youth he decided to teleport to her last location, unaware of it's disposition. He teleported to the location, but the room seemed empty other than a peculiar puddle of water next to an unoccupied chair in the center. HellMan's eyed the puddled and assumed the worse, which made him unbearably angry. \"SteelHawk, come in through the window at my location!\" he screamed into their communication's line. \"What? Why?\" asked SteelHawk \"WaterGirl's.... down\" replied HellMan. HellMan charged up a fireball, as he prepared for battle.", "SteelHawk burst in through the window only to find a thoroughly destroyed room with burnt grunts about. He dashed through the halls looking for his companion. Just more burnt thugs, although he noticed a strange human-shaped imprint charred onto the wall. He payed it no mind and ran along. Only a few rooms later he started running into active guards. He shot them down with no mercy. He took a few shots himself in the process, but his suit blocked them easily. Eventually he ran into a room with just Sin standing in wait. Sin shot him with a strange looking gun, but the bullet didn't go through his suit either. \"Where's HellMan\" screamed SteelHawk. \"He's dead. Didn't you see his cremation a few rooms back?\" replied Sin. Tears began to drip down SteelHawk's face, he was glad his helmet prevented Sin from seeing them. Sin started to laugh \"I can tell you're crying under that helmet boy\". SteelHawk started to get scared. He always thought HellMan and WaterGirl were unkillable. He decided he was probably walking into some kind of trap and flew out the nearest window. ", "SteelHawk flew extremely high and finally got control of his panic. \"Ca- Captain Honor are you there?\" he asked. \"Yes I'm here SteelHawk\" readily replied The Captain. \"I don't know what to do Captain, I think... I think WaterGirl and HellMan are... dead...\" Captain Honor felt horrible on the inside, but knew now was not the time for weakness. So he said \"Don't worry SteelHawk, I'll deal with this\". Just as he heard the message SteelHawk started to fall. He spent the seconds he had while falling to fiddle with his suit and didn't have the time to message Captain Honor. SteelHawk found the problem, it seems whatever Sin shot him with was lodged in his suit, activated, and was now shutting down his flight capabilities. SteelHawk managed to pry the invading device from his suit, but just as his suit started up again he crashed into the concrete.", "Captain Honor heard a loud crash outside, and asked SteelHawk what was going on. There was no reply. He ran into a few more guards but they all ran away from him. \"Wow looks like these thugs finally learned to not mess with Captain Honor\" he said to himself. Eventually he reached Sin. Sin let out a gasp of very dramatic surprise. \"How did you make it here!\" Sin yelled. \"Hah, your pathetic guards ran away from me. I guess you should up their pay huh?\" joked Captain Honor. \"I guess loyalty is more expensive than I thought now adays\" replied Sin with a smirk. Captain Honor chuckled and then got into fighting stance. Sin did the same and they started exchanging blows with there fists. ", "It went back and forth. They seemed evenly matched in kick boxing techniques, though both seemed to be tiring. Captain Honor then threw a wild hay-maker, Sin saw it coming from a mile away and dodged preemptively. But the punch was a  trick and turned into a grab. Captain Honor held Sin's collar and perfectly performed a hipthrow slamming Sin onto the ground. Captain Honor then stuck his knee onto Sin's chest and proclaimed victory as he said \"It's over Sin, I got you\". ", "\"Oh darn, you got me again Captain Honor!\" yelled Sin. \"What have you done with my comrades Sin?\" asked Honor. Sin looked around awkwardly not sure what to say. \"OUT WITH IT SCUM!\" yelled The Captain. Sin sighed and said \"Do you really want to know?\", \"OF COURSE I DO TELL ME NOW!\". Sin got a very somber and serious look on his face and said \"They're dead\". Captain Honor was shocked, he was so sure SteelHawk was just exaggerating and panicking like an amateur when he said they were dead earlier. \"That's impossible, how could a lowly villain like you defeat them?\" asked Captain Honor. \"I don't want to tell you\" said Sin. \"What why not?\" asked The Captain. \"Cause you were always my favorite hero going up...\" Honor almost blushed at the genuine heart to heart compliment, but eventually regained his composure to ask \"But, what's that got to do with anything?\" Sin kept saying he didn't want to tell Captain Honor, but Honor kept asking getting more and more angry. Sin even started to say he would give up the hostage and leave if Honor just dropped the questions. But Honor was far too angry for that and instead started slapping and eventually punching Sin in the face until Sin finally started getting mad himself. ", "His eyes watery Sin told Honor the truth. \"Look, most of us villains were just normal kids growing up. And... like normal kids we all had our heroes. And me, like a lot of my associates really looked up to you Captain Honor. The world has become a fucked up place sir, but you and the few old heroes who are left somehow stayed above all that. So we've sort of... been going easy on you\". \"Easy on me? I don't believe you!\" replied Captain Honor. A forcefield suddenly appeared around Sin, and expanded out pushing Captain Honor back. Honor tried punching the force field, but did nothing but hurt his own hand. \"Why... why if you really look up to me did you do all this!?\" yelled Captain Honor. \"Honestly, I don't think you could understand me without becoming a villain yourself. I don't want to ever see that happen\". Sin activated his jet-boots and blasted out of the room. His group scattered, but not before executing the Mayor.

Smith guided the rover deeper into the temple. Pillars adorned the crumbling ceiling, and mosiacs of strange and foreign creatures seemed to stare down the camera, watching this intruder. Red dust covered almost everything in the atrium. In the center though, the statue stood as glorious as it ever had. A giant, basalt statue of a humanoid life form, though not quite human. It had two eyes, though they were placed farther apart than most human's. The nose was flat, with slits instead of nostrils. Instead of ears, it had flaps, covering the supposed holes sound went into. It's mouth had no lips, just an opening.

The first stone was the only stone that had been colored. Barrow couldn't completely tell, but the more he studied the stone, the more it resembled a Sun. He counted 4 stones over.

Being one of three geologists brought to the Martian Colonial Project meant he had a certain amount of pull when his subterranial indicators showed a perfect geometric shape, but the task of digging a 10 meter hole into the ground would rob the other teams of valuable labor. Thompson didn't envy Lin's position as Expedition commander but he also couldn't let the opportunity to research naturally occurring geodes on the Martian surface go wasted. After a long period of time, the American leader finally relented, allowing Thompson to snag up one of the heavy excavator bots and head out to the potential site.", "The Canadian, nick-named 'Vancouver', had been in such a rush to get out to the indicator on his map that he'd almost forgotten to finish zipping on his boots and activating his external proximity speakers.

The seismic drone had been automatically wandering around in an ever expanding spiral, sending a constant feed of findings back to the command outpost. The research project was tasked with assessing the sustainability of colonial efforts and with figuring out what sort of life-support equipment would work best for continued human efforts on the ancient world. As Thompson brought his machine to a dusty stop in the open landscape he brought up his drone command console and set the seismic drone back to wandering off and out of the way.", "With a few deft hand motions the heavy excavator machine planted out stabilizing rods from its sides and lowered its ant-eater looking head into the ground. Dust roiled out in all directions and soon the eerie glow of star and distant sun light was drowned out in a swirl of red dust. Thompson leaned back and monitored his scanners, hands interlocked and folded on his belly. The various gauges and read-backs all displaying electrical charge, output, dwindling solar input in the smothering dust-cloud, and heat buildups. He was always attentive to heat buildups, a nearly kilometer walk back to the base-camp because his digger had overheated had taught him a lesson weeks ago. A lesson that Lin ensured he would remember by sending him back out with the recovery team to fix and drive the very same digger back to base camp. ", "The top layers of soil were dusted away quickly, the machine blasting the soil with pressurized gasses and grinders pulverizing heavier sediments out of the way, all of it being sucked into the machine and ejected high and away, well clear of the dig. From a distance the whole affair would look like a smoldering red smoke plume. Up close, behind the viewing ports it reminded Thompson of the dust storms when they were in training deep in the Mojave Desert. The dig was going quickly, almost alarmingly quickly. Normally there would be a thin sheen of dust and then ancient clay followed by a shale layer further down, but all of the soil being cast aside with thin and powdery, almost ashen. The digger had readjusted its stabilizers, flank excavating equipment leveling out the soil around it as the hole widened and deepened automatically. Thompson looked out and watched the horizon of his hole swallow the machine steadily. The readouts continued feed him information about the machine, everything was flowing well in the green indicators.", "The grinder whirred and latched onto something hard, the geologist glanced at his depth reading, the needle rested on a solid \"10\". His hand swung out and clamped onto the emergency stop, the whole machine rumbling and humming to a slow and then a stop.

Unbuckling and leaping down from the craft he could recall the perfect shape of the geode, wondering what sort of naturally occurring crystals would be generated on a totally alien planet.

Many mages have expressed a desire to summon some higher ranking Daedra to see what they know and Scholars are pretty sure that the Eye is older than most, if not all Nordic civilization. So the answer is a solid maybe.", "Anyway where was I? Ah yes, Magnus was one of the Et-Ada. You see way back in the beginning, the Dawn Era, Shor convinced a bunch of the other Et-Ada to make Mundus. Magnus was the architect of Mundus, he designed th.

I'm getting there, don't ask simple questions if you don't want long answers. ", "Anyway, Mundus. Mundus was taking a lot of energy and Magnus and the Magna Ge, a bunch of other Et-Ada, decided to leave. Here's the important bit - When Magnus decided to leave back to the Aetherius Mundus was basically already made - so rather than just going back easily he had to force his way back, and Magnus was not weak, not at all, he punched straight through the sky straight back to Aetherius. This is what made the Sun, which is why its called Magnus. The Magna Ge, the other Et-Ada followed suit, making the stars. ", "Now I want you to Compare the size of the sun to  the size of the stars. Quite different aren't they. See a few theories have popped up on why that is but the simplest is that through Magnus leaving Mundus in such a violent way, this weakened the barriers of Mundus, allowing the Magna Ge to leave easier. ", "Now can you guess why the candles don't need to be mantained? Its quite a simple reason after you realize that the candles aren't normal flames. They are tiny holes poked through the fabric of Mundus into Aetherious itself. Outrageous right? You would think that this would be dangerous but here's the thing, it is such a tiny hole that the only Magicka that can get through is used up in maintaining the flame.", "Ahhh I see you asking the old question of 'If these candle fires are holes into Aetherious why don't we make bigger holes and use them for research and other such things?' For one it is because it is really hard to do, it is easy to poke a small hole and it get harder the larger it is. Secondly, this barrier is what stops the Daedra from coming in whenever they feel like, and if you remember the Oblivion Crisis you can see why this is a good thing, so tearing holes into it may cause irreparable damage. And finally poking a hole large enough to be of use through the very fabric of existence into a realm of Gods who may not be that pleased to see us is, well, a really bad idea.", "Small holes are fine, encouraged even. It is said to enrich the atmosphere with Magicka, though not much research has been done on it. The fact remains that when a public building, such as a shop or a Royal hall, is being built or rebuilt a mage is often hired to light the candles. This is a thing that goes back to before the Merethic Era.

With a small flick of his wrist, a ball of light illuminated the small room.", "\n\"A mage, huh? If you have magic, why bother calling us? Why not bore the Draugr to death?\" Vilkas snorted at his own joke. Radnax muttered under his breath as he walked to the nearest candlestick and gathered the melted wax hanging off the iron, putting it into a small bag on his waist. From his sack he withdrew some long candles, enchanted to last weeks at a time, and stuck them into their sockets.", "\n\"Candles? That's why we're here!?\" Vilkas began to laugh even louder. A small jet of flame came from Radnax's finger as he lit the candles.", "\n\"It's not the candles, it's the ritual. The respect.\" Radnax turned to the two Nords. \"Do you two not respect the dead?\"", "\n\"We respect the dead, but not Draugr.

He fought through a siege at Whiterun, slaughtered over a hundred goblin invaders and ended the starvation of the people.\" Moving over to another spot, he pointed at another Draugr, \"This is Ilmar Bowmaster, she could hit a hawk dead in the eye from across the Bay at Solitude. She served the High King of Skyrim at the time by being a master assassin and a defender up on high.

Radnax so wished to hit him over the head with his heavy sack of candles, but that would just break the candles and waste his time.", "\n\"And they said you were the smart one...\" Radnax muttered as he turned to place more candles. Before Vilkas could respond, a dry cough could be heard.", "\n\"Farkas, was that you?\" Vilkas inquired.", "\n\"No, brother, it's them.\" Farkas said, drawing a heavy looking sword. \"Come between us, Radnax.\" He added. Radnax needed no further invitation, and ran to hide behind the two huge Nords.", "\nAt first just one Draugr stood, but it was followed by another, then two more, and from down a dark tunnel a loud metal sound could be heard.", "\n\"Why aren't they attacking?\" Farkas asked, baring his teeth as if to bite them to death. The metal sound came to a crescendo as a Draugr a full head and a half taller, and nearly half again as wide as the others stepped from the tunnel, who hefted an axe that looked like it could split a mountain, to say nothing of their armor.", "\n\"Who's that one, Radnax?\" Vilkas asked.", "\n\"Sometimes, the actions of the dead are so heinous, they are stripped from memory. There was said to be one of them here. I think this one is him, and I think he's the leader.\" Radnax began to tremble.", "\nAs if to confirm, Nameless let loose a dry sounding shout in a long since dead tongue, and pointed to the intruders. The four lesser Draugr burst forth as one, swinging their ancient steel at the Companions.

Radnax leaned forward and began to shout, pouring every ounce of his being into this fire. But as quick as it came, the fire ended, and Radnax fell to his side, gasping for breath.", "\nThe Draugr laughed, a drier and more feeble laugh than before, and stepped forward to execute the mage. As he put weight on his leg though, it crumbled to ash. With a startled gasp, Nameless reached out to brace against the fall, only to have his arm fall apart as well. He looked up and saw Radnax, the reason for this humiliation and reached out to grab him, only for a flash of steel to split his now exposed skull.", "\nFarkas withdrew his sword from the Draugr's skull and went to Vilkas' aid first. \"What happened to the other three?\" Vilkas asked.", "\n\"They scattered when they saw what was happening to the Big guy.\" Farkas explained as he lifted his brother to his feet.", "\n\"And Radnax?\" Vilkas continued.", "\n\"I'm fine.\" The mage managed to get out between heavy breaths.

They aren't effortless. Everything else is done as if it's second nature to us. We don't have to do anything but concentrate. It just works. The lights are the only part of this job that is done manually. The lights can and will go out. And the millisecond they do, I relight them. The worst ones are the torches in frozen, windy caves. They are in a constant limbo state of being lit and going out. Talk about a headache. And the cracks and other light sources? They aren't really cracks. It's a small space with a torch in it, that we put a glass filter over to simulate sunlight. The spells? That's fake light too.

In my time I got pretty much non-stop praise as well. But that was only after I performed heroic feats of courage and honor. My fame wasn't handed to me on a silver platter. I had to earn it.", "The distant sound of the dungeon's doors opening broke me out of my reverie. I couldn't stay here long. I exited the dungeon and put on the ring. Then the other ring.

Besides, with its detect life enchantment, I could watch the Dragonborn's progress through the dungeon, and it would be easier to follow him towards the next one. Once he got close enough that I knew which dungeon he was headed for, I could run ahead, maybe conjure a couple atronachs to slow him down. Then I'd get to work doing the same thing all over again: lighting the damn torches and candles.", "Sometimes I found myself wondering why I bother. Why couldn't I just stop doing this? Why couldn't I leave the Dragonborn to his own devices? It's not like I had the same kind of help when I was an adventurer.

I will continue to watch over the Dragonborn until he tires of his journeys, however long that takes.", "I was so caught up in my thoughts I didn't realize the Dragonborn had left the dungeon until he walked right into me.

I stayed as silent as possible, slowly backing away from him.", "\"Laas Yah Nir,\" he whispered. Dammit. I didn't know much in the dragon tongue, but I knew what that meant. It was the Aura Whisper shout. It gave the same effect as a detect life enchantment or potion. He knew where I was.", "He pointed his sword at me and said \"Reveal yourself, rogue!\"", "I tensed, wondering if I could get away and hope for him to forget this encounter. No, that wouldn't work. Even if I got away, he'd be on high alert for awhile afterwards. I wouldn't be able to keep watching over him without him knowing.", "I sighed, straightened up, and took off my cowl.

Candles last longer, usually about a day before needing to be swapped out for entirely new ones. In my sack lies a half-tonne of worn out candlesticks.

People generally don't mind you going into their homes or even personal chambers so don't worry about that. ", "The main issue is the dungeon, caves and castles. Those torches last about an hour max and so you will need to rush about with your vat of fuel. Stifle out the flames ", " then once the smoke stops dunk them into the vat, remix them into position and relight. I lost a few too many beard hairs dunking before extinguishing the flames.

Hauling the candlesticks will kill your back and the vat of fuel is known to occasionally and spontaneously explode.

Why do you want to be a level designer?\"", "I took a deep breath. I knew that the answer to this question would be way more important than any question about my hard skills. The job of a level designer differs greatly between studios. They always have to teach their design rules and workflows to new people, no matter how experienced they may be. But you can't teach someone to fit into the team.", "\"There are so many reasons,\" I started, and instantly regretted it because now I would have to come up with a lot of reasons... \"It's all I ever wanted to do, ever since I was old enough to understand that games are made by people and that you could do that as a job. When I was twelve, I wrote an essay about how Thief: The Dark Project used light and shadows both as a gameplay mechanic and for guiding the player. It's trivial and funny to read nowadays, but I've been analyzing level design ever since. Soon after, I started building PvE maps for Half-Life. Eventually, I went to game design school to get a formal education and besides school, I started making mods for Oblivion. That's when I knew that I just had to come here. Your games are so detailed and beautiful and full of good and evil, life and death, light and darkness, and I want to be a part of it.\"", "That long monologue left me breathless, and I hoped it was enough to convince him. ", "\"You mentioned game design school,\" Jeff said, unimpressed. \"What did they teach you there?\"", "\"Well... To be honest, not that much. I don't want to sound presumptuous, but I had learned most that from books and online articles before. But it was still a good opportunity to work with a team on a project under time pressure. So I learned a lot about project management, I guess.\"", "Jeff smiled weakly and looked at me over his glasses. \"I don't usually hire people from game design school. They learn all the wrong things and fancy themselves as great designers when they can't even tell me the names of three level designers they admire. Who do you admire, Philipp?\"", "That one was easy. \"Shigeru Miyamoto is an absolute genius. Just look at the first few minutes of Super Mario Bros., how absolutely perfectly that teaches you how to play. I also admire Hidetaka Miyazaki. Dark Souls has such a beautiful, coherent and functional level design, I cried tears of joy when I first played it. And then, of course, you.\" I smiled sheepishly.", "Jeff rolled his eyes and chuckled. \"Alright, you sure seem to have the right kind of passion. I also checked out your Oblivion mod. I think your dialogues were a little too wordy. But you're not applying as a writer, so what. The level design was solid. I like how you put those candles everywhere.\"", "\"Yes, I think it's important to always have an explanation where the light is coming from, and I found those candle assets on the Nexus and I thought candles never really look out of place. Though maybe I overdid it a little. It doesn't really make sense that all the candles are lit in an ancient tomb that hasn't been disturbed in a thousand years...\"", "\"So what do you think?\" Jeff said. \"You wanna do this for our new Elder Scrolls game, too?\"", "My jaw dropped. They offered me a job. They want me to work on the next Elder Scrolls title. I had so many ideas! I would build dungeons that tell a story through the environment, that actually made sense, where you circle around in a spiral and get back to the landmark you saw at the beginning and be awe-struck by how large and beautiful and believable this world is. I would help them create the best Elder Scrolls game ever!", "\"Of course I do!\", I blasted out. ", "\"But I must warn you,\" Jeff said. \"We're getting close to release. The next few months will be full on crunch time. You'll basically live in Skyrim. And you won't rest until every building, every tomb and every last cave is littered with burning candles. You think you can do that?\"", "\"Wait a minute, you just want to hire me to put candles everywhere?\"", "\"Someone has to do it.\"", "\"But that's completely unrealistic. Why would there be candles burning in an ancient tomb? Who would light a candle there?\"", "\"Well you would, Philipp! Now, do you want the job or not?

I tossed the paint chip and guac combo in my mouth.", "I took a moment to savor the flavor. Then I gagged as the full flavor hit me.

Not even the sweet taste of lead would make the dish less uncomfortable.", "Coughing and spewing green-and-red guac all over poor kermit's vader-masked face, I glanced down. On the floor was a note. It read:", "\"The guacabowle is $50, I accept cash or credit only.\"\n-JEB!", "Speagrot had no recollection of how it had come to this, but he was firmly planted into his bed. That is to say, he was about to go to sleep, but a tiny voice in his head told him not to do it.", "\"Don't do it!\" said the voice with desperation and immediacy in it's intonation, \"It's barely 3 PM!\"", "But what did the voice know of sleeping, Speagrot thought to himself, \"It doesn't even have a physical body with which to experience tiredness!\"", "Speagrot reached under his bed, expecting nothing less than a job opportunity. He heard the pitter patter of tiny feet, and then a tiny hand grabbed his. He gave it a firm, confident, yet restrained handshake. He didn't want to seem disinterested, but even less did he want to seem desparate. The sheer verbosity of this handshake made the ground beneath Speagrot's bed quake, and sounds of windows breaking could be heard coming from neighboring houses.", "\"You're hired!\" said a tiny voice. Speagrot dangled his torso off of the side of his bed so that he could take a look under it, his feet firmly hooked around the other side of the bed, so as not to fall off. Under his bed, he discovered, was a tiny man in a tiny business suit, handing him a tiny contract and a tiny pen with which to sign said contract. If he wasn't tiny, he would be remarkably tall - but he ", " tiny. So tiny, in fact, that the underside of the bed seemed like the ceiling of a large industrial property, at least when compared to him. He had slicked back jet black hair, cold brown eyes and a tight smile on his thin lips.", "\"Who are you?\" inquired Speagrot.\n\"My name is Pick Parantalleius. I own this company\", he said as he motioned towards the dusty floorboards under Speagrot's bed.\n\"Well, Pick, I'm quite sure I haven't seen you around before,\" said Speagrot, making Pick visibly uncomfortable, \"But then again, I am blind.\"\nA small amount of air involuntarily left Pick's lungs and made his vocal chords vibrate in a peculiar way. \"You're blind?\"\n\"No,\" said Speagrot while fumbling with a sizable jar of mayonnaise behind his back, \"What makes you think that?\"", "Pick Parantalleius stumbled backwards from the sheer force of the stratagem that had been brought to execution solely because he had lowered his guard. His eyes widened and his eyebrows furled and unfurled at a rapid rate. He couldn't believe the magnitude of the swindle that had just transpired with himself on the receiving end. \"This one is good,\" he thought to himself, \"But not even nearly as good as I am!\"", "\"You've tricked me,\" said Pick, while straightening his stance into a confident and imposing one, \"but no matter!\"", "As he uttered the words, the physical substance that made this world exist started turning into nothingness. Both men could feel their very beings disappear in the most horrific of ways - not with violence, but with the numbest pain imaginable. It felt like being under local anesthetic and watching somebody tend to your legs with a sledgehammer. Just before everything disappeared, Pick managed to squeeze a few final words out of his throat: \"I shouldn't have said that!\"", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Speagrot's eyes fluttered open. He was firmly planted into his bed. That is to say, he had just woken up, the tiny voice inside his head nowhere to be found.", "After hearing that, I tiredly said, \"what...\", the hand violently pulled me under the bed. Darkness ensued and it got really loud, really fast. I hit a couple things falling, flying, I had no clue which direction I was going. Then, I thought I saw a light. After spinning for what seem like forever, I finally straightened out and saw that light was enlarging, getting closer. I hit the ground with so much force, but yet, I wasn't dead. I thought, \"Maybe I am dead? Could I have died in my sleep?\". I stood up and looked around. It was Hell. Literally, it had a big sign that said, \"Welcome to Hell.\". I guess Lucifer has a sense of humor.\nA small demon looking thing seemed to appear out of no where. It said, \"Welcome to Hell. I'm the Devil's assistant, Frank. You have been hired to be the new Grimreaper. A.k.a. the ArchAngel of Death.\" It said all of this in a high pitched scratchy voice. \"I'm what?\" I said. \"The new Grimreaper.\" He responded. \"Your past experience with death and killing are great for this job.\" said Frank. \"So me being a retired MARSOC, ex-hitman, and ex-CIA, makes me... well I understand now but, how the hell did I get down here?\" I said. \"You died, well... poisoned you could say. By your own boss, the President, that mother...\", \"I was poisoned!\" I said as I turned around to see whose deep voice that was. It was Satan himself. My jaw dropped, and I died again. He smiled and said, \"Nice to meet you.\", he said reaching out to shake my hand, \"I figured since we're gonna be bestfriends, we should meet. Here's you wings, cloak, and scythe.\". Wings flung out of my back, the cloak flew in me, and scythe appeared in my hand. Terrified I pulled the hood off and looked in a mirror that was there for what ever dramatic reason, and my face wasn't me, it was just a skull. \"Okay, before you scream, what's your name?\" Said Frank. \"Jim\". \"Well Jim isn't a very powerful name. How about... Nathaniel. That's a powerful name\" again that was Frank. The Devil said sure and sent me up to do my job.", "\"And that's how I became the death angel.\", I told my grandson.

Fear spread throughout my body, the voice wasn't deep and bellowing, it sounded like an elderly white mans voice, with long drawn syllables at the end of certain words. I got out of bed slowly, reaching for what ever weapon I could find in my room. Luckily for me I used to play baseball so I grabbed the nearest bat I could find. \"Come out from under that bed and we can talk about the terms of my employment.\" Without a word from the unidentified voice the dram of the bed shook violently and seemed to raise off the ground. The figure of a man rose from underneath the bed. I couldn't see his features well in the dark room, but he spoke again, \"As I said before you're hired. I need a select group of people to assist me in a very tiresome task that will better the world.\" I stared at the dark silhouette in shock, but I knew I needed to stall for time until I could think of a plan. The man spoke again, \"First off, you can put that bat away Jeremy, you won't be needing it. Secondly, you didn't have to apply for this job, I sought you out because I need the best of the best.\" I stared in disbelief, what was happening? My mind raced uncontrollably as I tried to think of what to do. \"Well, if I truly am the best of the best then we should fill out a contract, but first tell me what the job is?\" The voice spoke silently and slowly, \"The job is simple, in the United States, immigration has become a growing concern. Americans are losing jobs and money to these people coming in. Our job is to build something to stop it, something to stop them all. Our job is to make... The Wall.\" I dashed quickly over to the door of my room and flipped the light switch. Before me he stood, his hair was blond and combed over to the right. His skin had a light orangish glow to it. He was radiant such as a god would be, absolutely brilliant. He looked deep into my eyes and placed a firm hand on my shoulder, \"Hello Jeremy, are you ready?\" President Trump said meaningfully. I was still in shock at the glory of the man before me, \"Ready for what, sir?\" He met my eyes, I winced at the power I could see within them, \"Ready to make America great again?\" ", "I yanked my hand back and pulled it to the relative safety of my other hand.  \"Who's there and how the fuck did you get in my apartment?!\" I kept my eyes locked at the edge of the bed and began clawing for a heavy object.", "\"Please, pardon my intrusion, dear.\" The voice was opulent, yet haunting.

A fresh wave of terror washed over my soon-to-be corpse as the bed shifted, the hand pulling itself up, revealing that where I had expected to see a body, there was none. The forearm abruptly ceased to an inch of exposed ulna and radius, smooth around the previously broken edges.

", "Jamie had finally convinced his bosses to see things his way. \u201cLook, I was the one who brought her in, I can get her to cooperate. Even if she reacts\u2026 unexpectedly,\u201d Jamie had said, tapping the vest they had fitted over him, \u201cI\u2019ll be able to handle it with this, right?\u201d", "Eventually, only one other agent was assigned, and even he was left to stand watch at the end of the long driveway, nervously peering into the darkness as Jamie crossed the lawn, alone, to rap sharply on the ornate mahogany door.", "\u201cYou promised me I would be left alone,\u201d hissed the voice, bouncing around sharply in the confines of Jamie\u2019s skull.", "\u201cLwellyn, you have no idea the lengths I\u2019ve gone to keep you safe,\u201d growled Jamie, a note of irritation creeping into his voice. It was true, and righteous indignation swirled in his belly, which he fought to suppress. \u201cBut I am one lone man, trying to make the best of a right shitshow, so forgive me if you are to be disturbed.\u201d", "The door swung open on its own, and the d\u00e9cor within was as Jamie expected of a designer who, having been forbidden to use her favourite colours or motifs, had suddenly been set free to do as she would.", "In other words, there was running water, everywhere. An arresting fountain took centre-stage in the hall, bubbling as the water jets twirled and spun gracefully in the air. Two double-storey waterfalls, cleverly-designed waterspouts from on high, gushed into swirling pools. Streams of water, chugging along inset rivulets, ran across the length of the floor.", "Lwellyn snapped her fingers, and suddenly, all the water ceased. They did not stop, in the way that one may expect if a tap were turned off. Rather, all the water froze where they were, transfixed in motion, as if it were all a streaming video which was in the midst of buffering.", "Lwellyn saw the look in Jamie\u2019s eyes, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here ten years, Jamie, and still I cannot believe your Homeworld takes for granted what we struggle so hard to replace. So forgive me my indulgences.\u201d", "\u201cOh no, I suppose I would have done the same thing,\u201d said Jamie, a wistful edge to his tone, \u201cEvery inch of my home would be filled with every trinket, vessel or embodiment of Magic I could lay my hands on. I understand the allure of what we do not have, Lwellyn, very well.\u201d", "It was somewhat ironic that even though Jamie was the leader of the global think-tank which specialized in advising world governments on trans-world relations, he had never personally crossed over into any of the other Homeworlds. He was intimately aware that crossing over was safe, that one only had to prepare the necessary substitutes \u2013 for example, Lwellyn\u2019s Homeworld, Dessicae, possessed the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Magic in abundance, but Water was notably absent, so that had to be brought along.", "Early forays had determined that it was Magic which had, in a sense, adapted to help Dessicae survive despite the absence of Water. Magic was intangible, omnipotent, and it flowed so richly in Dessicae that it filled in all the roles which Water would normally have played on Jamie\u2019s Homeworld. Subsequent reports confirmed that it was the same on the other Homeworlds \u2013 regardless of which element was missing on that Homeworld, Magic was the glue which bound them all together.", "It was only on Jamie\u2019s Homeworld, where Earth, Air, Fire and Water were all present and accounted for, that Magic had, perhaps deciding that it had no role to play, slinked away.", "\u201cThis cannot be a courtesy call,\u201d said Lwellyn, eyes narrowing, \u201cI am indebted to you, but not once since you took me in as a refugee have you ever called on me in a personal capacity. It has always been about work, and this cannot be different.\u201d", "\u201cYou are astute, and I shall be blunt then. I\u2019ve come to ask for you to unlock the Portal to your Homeworld.\u201d", "Jamie\u2019s request hung in the air, and eventually Lwellyn laughed. \u201cYou must be joking. How do you expect me to be able to do tha-\u201d", "\u201cWe will inform Dessicae that we have finally hunted you down, rooted you out from your hiding place amongst our populace. You will return a political prisoner, but our operatives will be in place to spring you out. We just need you, as a native, to weave the spells needed to fully open the Portal to Dessicae. Once that is done, your debt is clear, and you can return here to live out the rest of your life in peace.\u201d ", "\u201cAnd why the hell would I do that?\u201d", "Jamie had anticipated this question. He had two answers prepared, the first being an appeal to logic. He would show Lwellyn the collected data, that the four elements in Jamie\u2019s Homeworld were irreversibly poisoned, and that open channels were needed to the other Homeworlds so that the tainted elements could be replaced. Negotiations for peaceful acquisition of resources were stalling, and time was running out.", "From that perspective, the problem was suddenly a matter of national, nay, global security.", "And to round off the logical explanation, Jamie would have pointed out that when it came down to a matter of global security, a certain amount of force was allowed, and the opening of the Portals was the first step to a policy they had termed \u201cEnforced Survival\u201d.", "But Lwellyn was not susceptible to logical arguments, as Jamie\u2019s memory served him, so instead he said, \u201cWe have reason to believe your daughter is alive in Dessicae. These photographs were taken just last month. You won\u2019t just be helping your adopted Homeworld survive, you will be bringing your daughter home.\u201d", "Jamie\u2019s hands were already on his vest, and his personal Barrier was activated mere seconds before Lwellyn\u2019s psychic scream tore through the mansion. Part guilt for abandoning the child she thought had died all those years ago, part anguish for not doing more, part shame for moving on when her own flesh and blood still suffered in Dessicae, the Magic spilled out of Lwellyn, a malevolent manifestation of her pain.", "Outside, a hundred feet away, the special agent crumpled to his knees, grabbing his head in pain. The hidden gears and circuits in Jamie\u2019s vest toiled on, shielding him more than adequately. Jamie gave the woman, sobbing poignantly on the floor, a full minute before he pressed his case.", "\u201cWill you help us open the Portal?

Dennis said to me while taking a small break \"I can get you out, my days are gone\" \"But Dennis....\" \"No you must go on.\" He took the fall so I can leave with no harm. What Kim did was no good, I understand his situation, being a lonely chubby man dictacting an isolated country where everyone criticized you, pretty harsh man, all he needed was a friend. so anyways, I said my goodbyes and left and never looked back.

I paced around for a bit in front of the gargoyle, trying to figure out what it could be, when the statue began to move. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the shiny robes of the not-Dumbledore. It suddenly occurred to me that I had not exactly planned what I would do when I saw him.

He was always poking fun at me, and I would normally revel in the attention, but something was definitely not right with the man sitting front and center of the room enthusiastically talking to Professor McGonagall. During his welcoming speech, he seemed to have much more vigor than I'd ever seen him display before. I've always seen Dumbledore as such a fragile man, well, on the outside, at least. And was his accent different? Once again, my thoughts were interrupted.", "\"Seriously, are you alright? You keep staring at Dumbledore. There's nothing wrong with him. He's the same old, crazy buffoon he's always been,\" my friend insisted. \"You're probably just spooked with all the Sirius Black and dementor talk.\"", "\"Um. Yeah. Maybe you're right,\" I said half-heartedly. I wasn't scared of Sirius Black, and there was no way I was getting within arm's reach of a dementor to do me any harm. I knew something was up with Dumbledore; I just couldn't put my finger on it. I looked over and saw Harry Potter and his gang of misfits huddled together at the Gryffindor table. They were always getting into trouble and probably plotting their next big, glorious move to steal the House Cup from Slytherin again, and it's not like any Dumbledore would ever take a Slytherin's side. Besides, Harry Potter, along with his pet weasel and mouse, would probably figure out whatever was wrong with Dumbledore soon enough. There was no sense in trying to meddle when it was known that they would. It's not like I'd ever get to be the hero anyway.", "I huffed and shoved a pumpkin pastie into my mouth.", "Dumbledore was different.  Horribly different.  The twinkle in his eye had gone.  Everyone else thought it was simply because of stress, the horrors of wars past revisiting us, but I felt differently.", "As a werewolf, I felt things in ways others never understood.  No one else formed opinions based on scent.  Only I had the reflexes to catch the looks on their faces that they thought no one saw.  It was my secret, my burden, and my curse.

Was he a totally different person, or had he changed, maybe lost something? ", "Then I looked, and sadly, my heightened senses focused on the ring.  It was gaudy, but what else could one expect from the flamboyant headmaster.  It held an ugly, reddish stone, surrounded by filigree.  The most striking part of his new jewelry, was the dark magic oozing out of the rock.  The scent was tart, rotten, and poisonous at the same time.  It also, despite the darkness to it, smelled familiar.  It smelled like the headmaster.  ", "My heart continued its fevered pace.  I'm smart, well read, and despite my unfortunate lycanthropy, a pure blood.  I had access to a library the likes Hogwarts had never seen.  I had seen and read things that few others knew existed, and yet, behind Granger, Potter, and Weasley the Moron, I flew under the radar.  Sadly for me, I knew what was in front of me.  \"Horcrux\" my mind and heart said.  \"Evil most foul\" my Lycan side growled.  ", "I knew that Dumbledore loved power, control, and mostly, adoration.  Is that enough to push a man to rend his very soul for a shot at immortality?  I thought not, clearly he disagreed.  What to do?

Looking around to see who was nearby, he dragged me to a semi-hidden statue nook and set his two goons to stand guard.", "\"Now, what is this about Dumbledore?\" he asked. He continued in a disgruntled voice, \"You do realize he's practically untouchable.\"", "I told him my suspicions. About how the headmaster's voice resonated differently - which I of course noticed because I was a musical prodigy. And noticing that I looked closer and realized he looked like a different man, from his eyes to his beard, even the way he carried himself was different!

You are being transferred to another school at the behest of your parents.\"", "It was something about the color of his eyes. No... not the color... that was the same ice blue. It was the twinkle in his eyes that was different. It was missing. Snuffed out like the candles in the Great Hall each night. That was how I knew. It had happened overnight. This subtle transformation and when I saw it I felt like I had been hit directly in the center of my chest. I remember frantically looking from face to face at breakfast that morning but no one seemed to notice. I must have looked panicked because my friend shook me and another threw the crust of a croissant at my face. At that moment the imposter locked eyes with me. His smile faded only briefly before returning with gusto. He winked at me and then turned to Professor McGonagall who was frantically talking in his direction. Between the news of Sirius Black and this newest development with the Headmaster I felt weak kneed as I reluctantly followed my friends to class. ", "Later that night... I adjusted my blue and silver scarf around my neck and followed my friends down the winding corridor back towards the large and enchanting room. As a muggleborn, that room will forever hold a special place in my heart because it was the only time I truly felt home. Here, under the glittering starry sky on the night I was sorted I finally felt like I was home. The Headmaster immediately became a shining beacon of safety and friendliness... strength. All of the things I was missing in my previous life. However, tonight was different because I had the overwhelming feeling of dread. I have been through some tough and rough times but this particular sensation has never felt so viciseral... so powerful. I could practically taste it now. Metallic. Bloody. Sickening. All at once, I found myself stepping through the open doors and, like my fellow students, went wide eyed at the sight of so many sleeping bags. There was absolutely a threat to the school and the professors knew it too! They had sensed it! They had seen that twinkle leave his eyes as I had seen it and they knew that our Headmaster had been replaced by... what? Well... it's not my place to act on something like this. I'm not like Potter... merrily skipping into dangerous situations right and left. Sticking his scarred forehead into places he didn't belong and into situations  wasn't qualified to handle. Sorry... that's the jealousy speaking. He's an alright guy all things considered. Surely he, being as close as he is to Dumbledore, would have seen it. However, when I looked over at Harry and his friends and saw them in such close proximity to the thing that had replaced our Headmaster I knew that they hadn't a clue. This was because of Sirius Black and only because of Sirius Black. ", "I kept my eye on him as he wove around the other students. My friends were distractingly speaking all at once. First about why we were here and what the Fat Lady had said when they finally found her. Then they moved on to more trivial topics of conversation. Ive never been great at multitasking so I stayed silent. After an entire day of looking, acting, and feeling ill my friends thankfully left me alone. ", "Dumbledore spoke to no one until the lights went out. I slid under the covers and continued to watch him. He was talking in a hushed voice with the other professors. Then I saw it... he turned ever so slightly and the side of his face rippled. The wrinkles that were ever present smoothed into younger and darker skin. My eyes travelled up to meet his. Suddenly a very uncharacteristic look of alarm registered on the once again old man's face. He turned to the professors who seemed unchanged. They hadn't noticed. No one had noticed. I was alone and out in the open with this person who now knew beyond any shred of a doubt that I had seen through his disguise. ", "I shook beneath my blankets. I rolled onto one side and across the gap saw Harry sleeping as the group of professors neared... as the imposter neared. Here was a boy being hunted by the most prolific villain to ever reach Azkaban and his greatest champion and protector was nowhere to be found. He was probably lying there thinking... worrying about the threat that laid outside those walls not knowing an even closer threat was standing a mere 6 feet away. A silvery wave of panic slid up my spine as I watched the imposter step ever closer to the scarred boy. I turned over. I couldn't watch. We aren't all born heroes. ", "After some time I felt his presence. He was near... a faint shadow fell long enough for me to see the outline of his head and shoulder on my friend's blanket next to mine. There he stayed for several moments which stretched on for what seemed like eternity. I shut my eyes and when I opened them he was gone. I heard his softly shuffling footsteps moving slowly away. I allowed myself to take a long and shuddering breath... I hadn't noticed I'd been holding it. I didn't sleep at all that night.

Yellow certainly wasn't too far out of place in the wizarding world and perhaps a pale white face wouldn't be very far out either. However the Hufflepuff that they belonged to was probably the most out of place person in Hogwarts, perhaps if one was excluding Defense Against the Dark Arts instructors.

The yellow-eyed third year turned his head to look at his house-mate. \"I am attempting to determine if there has been a difference in Professor Dumbledore.\"", "\"Oh?\" The shutterbug tilted his head and looked at Dumbledore who was regaling Professor Sprout with anecdotes about vanilla pudding. \"I thought something was off myself when I was taking photos at the Sorting.\" Soong lowered his gaze towards the camera. \"Do you have photographs from last year's Sorting?\"", "\"Yeah of course.\" Justin reached into his robes and pulled out a small stack of Polaroids. Soong looked down and rapidly shuffled through the irrelevant ones like the deck of cards he masterfully dealt for poker. Justin instinctively shuddered when he got a glimpse of the basilisk. Soong stopped and then raised a moving photograph of Dumbledore up and looked from the photo to the man and nodded. \"There is a definite difference in cranial structure as well as facial contours. Thank you Mr. Finch-Fletchley.\" Suddenly Soong rose up and tapped that strange pin. \"Computer, reset character Dumbledore for program 'Prisoner of Azkaban'.\"", "Suddenly for a moment the headmaster seemed to change back to what was remembered, but then suddenly returned, not missing a beat in his conversation.

Something is going on and I will get to the bottom of it. But why? Why is everyone turning a blind eye? Why are they ignoring the obvious swap out of our beloved headmaster?

I won\u2019t let the Headmaster down!\u201d Finally I can earn some recognition, finally people will look at me for once instead of always thinking about Harry Potter.

I quickly read the title and immediately found out my fate. The title read 'I'm the New Main Character of This Series' in a very flashy font. On the bottom corner near the spine was a large Blue number one. Turning a couple pages, I found something that shocked me and my very concept of reality I was living in. A panel of me reading this manga and looking at this exact panel. I was watching myself as it happened. \"Perhaps I think you would make a better main character.\"", "\"Wait, me? I don't understand. What you doing I supposed to do?\"", "\"Simple,\" he said raising one finger with a grin. \"Survive. Make it to the end of the series with you and your daughter alive.

I can't just give you the last book in the series... however, what I can do is give you one last gift.\" As I began to wonder what he meant, he snapped his fingers and my head began to throb as a surge of information rushed into my mind. At that point I knew... I mean, I know. This world, my world, it isn't real. It's all just someone's creation. Hell, it's not even a proper manga yet. It's just an idea someone on Reddit came up with after two minutes of thought. Everything that I have thought and said and how it was delivered is now being judged by a bunch of losers on the internet. His gift was knowledge of the fourth wall. At this point, the only thing I was uncertain of was whether or not the person before me actually exists outside of the series or is a plot device himself. \"Good question.\" Shut up. \" I'm not sure what I am myself. I know myself as something, but I don't even know if that's true or not.", "\"And that something is...?\"", "\"Someone who acts on whimsey. Someone who doesn't have much time to explain anymore.

McCallister showed us the dots and let us connect them. The first inside wire activity was a bunk, where they stole our equipment, then the mess hall, where they stole food. Then the latrine, where they lived. It was the only place we'd never check. He took the food BATs and ran a line from the lid to a few knives on the table tops, so that anyone opening the BAT to take food out would get a knife pulled on them. It didn't need to be much, he said, since if they live in the latrine even a slight cut would get infected and kill them in a week, or, worse yet, make them desperate. Double night watch he said, and put them inside the camp. ", "Then he took a plywood board, drilled a hole in it, and attached it to a plastic bag full of some of our dessert Jell-O. Then the exit to the latrine was left with a rake outside the door. Three paces after that he put a small pit with Punji Sticks.  ", "That night he prepped up our gear. At 3am, he took the plywood and on the side with the bag, he tied a claymore, facing down, looked up at us and said , \"I made my family dissappear.\"", "McCallister walked into the latrine, put the plywood on the latrine, and shifted the bag so that the gelatin would slowly pour into the latrine.

Charlie had thought he was putting a bayonnet in a man's ass, only now it was his ass with the hole in it.  There was a commotion, splashing, people climbing out of the latrine. We heard the distinct sound of a rake handle smashing into a mans head. Fromt he out house door two more men crawled in a river of fecal matter and liquid. One more limped out, stepped over the man hit by the rake, and fell into the punji sticks. McCallister took his entrenching shovel, looked at me and said, \"this is it, don't get scared now.\" and headed towards the outhouse.

You\u2019ll break it.\u201d He wrestled free of my small hands, entered into his bedroom (with plush red covers, in the style of a posh New York apartment stuck in time), and re-emerged with a dusty Remington shotgun. Christmas would never be the same again. ", "At this time, the two burglars were tiptoeing around the Christmas tree. One of them already had his right hand singed, and had a black eye. They had made him scream and flail hilariously. The other burglar was now within reach of the booby trap in the toy train, which was still running along its circular track. He would soon slip, fall, get electrocuted, and get up, ready for more. ", "A deep, rough voice bellowed from the upper floor, where we were gathered. ", "\u201cHey scum, steal some of this.\u201d From the overhanging platform, Mr McCallister aimed his shotgun at the shorter burglar (the one who had his hand singed, and a black eye), and it blew his head clean off. The burglar's head just didn\u2019t just get blackened with soot and smoky, no, it splashed all over the house, decorating the Christmas tree lavishly, like over-ripe cherries bursting with festive goodness. ", "Startled, the taller burglar instinctively tried to run, and his foot went straight into the small train. He flipped, and was carried high into the air. The burglar landed flat on his back, directly into a carefully positioned nail, puncturing his spine's fourth lumbar. ", "The cry which emerged was something I had never heard before. It was filled with agony and madness. The thief was twitching, flailing, tried to get up, but some of his vital muscles were paralysed. At this time, the toy train went round again, and a tiny metal contraption caught in his steel tipped boots, sending large currents through the poor man's body--large currents, the kind that fry people many times over. ", "He screamed harder and louder. Jeanne and I were already closing our eyes and held our hands tight against our ears, crouched in a corner, sobbing uncontrollably. The older man, terrifying in his silk pyjamas, stared at us with pure contempt, then turned away and walked slowly down the woooden stairs. ", "The screaming seemed to go on forever.  Throughout most of it, Mr McCallister peered down his nose at the poor convulsing burglar who was convulsing at his feet. Mr McCallister stared silently, with a cold glint in his eyes and horrible smile curled slightly on his lips. (We could see this, too, for by now everything was unravelling.) The thief wet himself and, through choked gasps, was crying for his mother. After the shaking and the screaming ended, he was blackened, and thick blackened blood leaked from his eyes, nose, anus, bellybutton and the charred tips of his fingers. The air smelt sickly of iron and barbecued meat. At least the screaming was over. And after twenty-five years of re-runs and re-boots, the magic, too, was finally over.

And a Happy New Year.\u201d ", "It's Purge Night once again, and I begin to prep my house for the numerous maniacs to come and try to murder me and my entire family. \nSoon, I hear the dreaded message, alerting everyone that the Purge has begun, and that for the next 12 hours all crimes are legal. \nGod, I'm happy that I invited Macaulay Culkin to stay with us this week. \nMy family, Macaulay, and I await for someone to knock on my door, or break a window or something.

Not like he's been busy acting or anything.", "I returned to the kitchen to see him midway through rolling a joint. My nerves were shot, these guys were going to be cracking the door any second!", "\n\"What the fuck are doing?\" I practically shouted. \"They're gonna be in here any second!\"", "\n\"Chill, man. I got this,\" he said between licks of the paper wrapping.", "\n\"What the hell do we do?\"", "\n\"Grab me a clothes hanger and an extension cord,\" he said.", "\n\"Alright,\" I said running off to fetch the items, \"that's what I'm talkin' about.\"", "\nThe two burglars were outside in the back yard. It looked like they were canvasing the entire exterior of the house, looking for the ideal entry point or any signs of habitation. I gave the items to Macaulay who had quickly cut the female end off and split the two wires apart from the power cable, then unwound the ends of the hanger. He then wrapped the metal wire hanger around the door knob and connected one of the wires to each end of the hanger. When he plugged the cable into the wall outlet the hanger quickly turned a glowing red, like a stove-top.", "\"That'll slow 'em down a bit,\" he said with a maniacal grin. \"Now, let's see what else we have to work with.\"", "We made our way to the garage where I kept most of my tools, along with any other odd junk that didn't have a place in the house proper.", "\"Umm...\" I said haltingly. \"What exactly are you..\"", "\n\"Just shut up and watch, I know what I'm doing.\"", "\n\"O...K...\"", "I followed him up the stairs and into the spare bedroom.", "\"Open that window,\" he said, nodding toward the window overlooking the back yard.", "As quietly as I could, I slid the window up and stole a peak downward to see where the two intruders were. The taller of the two was just approaching the back door with the other one behind him facing outward, no doubt keeping watch.", "\"They're right down there,\" I said pointing downward. \"What's the plan?\"", "\n\"Step aside,\" Macaulay said, his arms still full of tools, small Halloween decorations, and a rather large glass jar of screws.", "Macaulay waited before approaching the window. A second later we heard the shouts of pain coming from below. He must have tried the door knob.", "Without a second thought Culkin stepped forward and leaned his bundle out the window.", "\n\"Wait, are you just going to\u2014\"", "\nBut, before I could even finish my question he released his grasp on the odd assortment of items.", "\"What the fuck!\" came the shout amidst a horrible racket of clanging and crashes.", "\n\"Really?\" I said, looking puzzled. \"That's it?\"\n\"Almost,\" he said surely before walking out of the room.", "\n\"What's next?\" I asked, trying to keep up as he bounded down the stairs.", "\n\"Final act,\" was all the reply I received as he made his way toward the back door.", "\n\"Don't we need some more supplies?\" I asked. \"Some grease... paint cans... trip lines... something?\" I continued, quickly losing confidence in my esteemed guest's ability to recreate his classic cinematic house of tricks.", "In an unexpectedly high pitched voice reminiscent of the young Kevin McCallister Macaulay shouted, \"Come and get me, you filthy animals!\"", "\n\"What the hell was that?\" I tried asking.", "But, before i knew it the burglar kicked my door in, ripping the extension cord from the coiled hanger.", "\"You're gonna die, you little shit!\" growled the shorter of the two.", "\n\"Yeah, you think you can throw\u2014\" but, the man stopped mid-sentence. \"Wait, ain't you that kid from the movies?\"", "\nHis partner elbowed him, \"Hey, yeah.

Macaulay fired off another round as I reached to cover my ears from the deafening percussion.", "I hadn't realized I had closed my eyes and wasn't breathing until I finally opened them back up and took in a long breathe of air tainted by the smell of gunpowder. I could taste it in my mouth, a metallic taste that only added to the foreignness of the whole situation.", "\nThe screaming of the two would-be robbers on the floor brought me back to reality. Macaulay was still standing where he had been, holding the pistol leveled at them still.", "\"Now... you can call the fucking police like you should have done in the first place,\" he said with no lack of condescension. \"Actually, hold that thought. I wanna finish my smoke first.\"", "I stood dumbfounded for what felt like minutes before finally moving to find my phone.

Again?\" he'd said when he came out of the box at the back of the closet. I might have mistaken his tone for resignation, except the light in his eyes was blazing with fury. One delicate finger stabbed in my direction. \"You. Stay,\" came the husked command, and with a tic tugging at one cheek he wheeled and stalked to the bedroom door.

Because...God help me...", "He's coming back up the stairs. ", "Sitting alone in a dark living room was creepier than I expected.  I nervously drummed out a nonsense pattern on my knees and tried to think happy thoughts.  Two bright lights appeared among the half turned miniblinds of the front window and I bolted up and started pacing.  Steeling my nerves I ran to the kitchen and dug out a butcher knife to hold in front of me like an Olympic torch, then remembered that burglars don\u2019t use their headlights when they pull into driveways.

Over the last week, houses all along the block were getting broken into one after the other, and my house would be next. If the unknown thieves stuck to the schedule, I only had until tonight to prepare. ", "\"Macaulay, thank you so much for being here, it really means a lot to me. We've had a string of robberies and I know you've had some experience dealing with this sort of thing.\" Half of a burning cigarette clung to Macaulay's chapped lips. \"Yeah,\" he answered. \"I've done this more than a few times by now.\" His voice sounded nothing like the kid I grew up with. In fact, almost everything about him was different. Macaulay spoke with a low, smokey growl and whiskey lingered in his breath. A red scar ran down his grizzled face through a clouded eye, stopping just below the cheekbone. His hands were big and scratched up. I almost didn't recognize him.", "\"So what should we do?\" I asked. \"Should I get together some paint cans, toy cars, and stuff?\" ", "\"No, that's kid stuff. I'll be right back.\" He replied. He rose with no hesitation and walked out the front door leaving me alone in my home for a moment. He returned a minute or two later with a large, olive-colored duffel bag and got to work rigging something to the front door. He didn't say a word, just went right to work. His back was turned to me, so I couldn't really see what he was doing, but it seemed like he was pulling up my floorboards. He was quick and methodical, so I figured he knew what to do.", "\"Y'know, it's not like in the movies anymore bud. Out here in the real world, robbers kill people and don't think twice. You can't take any chances in home defense. The way I played it when I was a kid was way too risky. My style nowadays is much safer and people are much less likely to get hurt.\" ", "When he stepped away from the door, all I could see was a tripwire. Whatever it was rigged to was well hidden. The floorboards had been replaced and I was impressed to say the least; his handiwork had definitely improved since he was a kid.", "Over the course of the afternoon, Macaulay rigged several more doors and windows in the same way as the first one to cover all the bases. Perhaps it wasn't as much of a spectacle compared to the movie, but he assured me that that was all we needed. I was scared, but my faith in the world famous Culkin was strong. ", "The clock struck 1:00am. We had been hiding quietly in the darkened house for a few hours now, waiting for what was to come. I heard the back door creak open. \"You didn't even lock the back door?!\" I angrily whispered. \"Just wait.\" replied the darkness to my right. I heard a single footstep crossing the threshold of the door.", "Seemingly out of nowhere, a deafening boom shook the house followed by the most horrific and pained shriek I'll never forget. My adrenaline spiked and without thinking, I dashed out of the room downstairs to investigate. The screaming continued as I followed it through the house. My back door in the kitchen was wide open and moonlight streamed in. A gaping hole about the size of a cantaloupe was in my floor by the door and there was a man dressed in black laying on the ground. The robber sat on the ground holding his mostly blown-off legs and crying. Right at the kneecap, his left and right legs dangled by only a few sinewy tendons. The robber shook violently and was clearly in shock. Blood painted my hardwood floor like in a Quentin Tarantino movie.", "I just stared. I couldn't even hear the screaming anymore, but he was definitely still screaming. I stared until it was burned onto my retina and showed on the insides of my eyelids.", "Macaulay casually sauntered down the stairs, lit cigarette in hand. He passed me without a word and reached into the hole in the floor. He pulled out a sawed-off double barrel shotgun and removed both spent shells. \"Gets 'em every time!\" He said with a chuckle. I couldn't believe what was in front of me. \"He'll be dead in a moment, just give him a minute.\" Macaulay added. The robber then passed out from the shock.", "The front door flew open. There stood a masked man in all black. An accomplice must have come to investigate when he heard the noise. As he took a step forward into the house, instantly, at 1200 feet per second, several lead marbles exploded up through his cranial cavity and turned his brains into wallpaper. Right before my eyes, the top half of his skull vanished completely in a microsecond.", "\"That's why I rigged the other ones.\" Macaulay said proudly. \"I'm glad I could be of service to you, thank you for your business. You can make the check out to ", " He lit another cigarette and stepped over the gurgling corpse on the front patio. He collected his firearms and left without looking back.

As the footsteps hammered the steps into the hall, I felt the cold, slick handle of the knife being thrust into my hand.", "Mouth gaping, and before I could talk, Mac pointed at me as the lawman burst in.", "\"Look what you did, you little jerk.\" ", "[removed]", "Sighing heavily he pulled the needle from his arm, and cursed his luck. He had just shot sweet relief into is veins, and some asshat chose that moment to attempt a break in. He was in foul mood now, and decided he would kill this one. \nHe had a simple arrangement here. He was given enough money for his habit, and what little else he needed, including a place to crash. In exchange, he kept the burglars away. With the collapse of authority you needed protection, and he had a very specific set of talents.", "When all was said and done the guy had been too easy. There had obviously been no planning before hand.

He was beaten, forced to work, and when his captors discovered his innate intelligence, educated to an absurd level of competency in music, arts, science, mathematics, poetry, and battle. He excelled in battle. He excelled in everything, but combat was the one area in which he did not consistently procrastinate. It suited him, and so did his career. Epikrates did not want to sit alone and paint, or solve complex equations. He wanted to experience new things, meet people, travel to new and exciting places. Killing was an unfortunate requirement of his position, but he would rather have blood stains on his soul than live a life of boredom.", "The sky was beginning to turn gray, and there was now a distinct circular path carved into the leaves.

He rubbed his nose. No blood.. It came from the edge of the forest, but no one was there. In one swift movement, he grabbed the knife and slipped behind a tree, waiting.", "The sound was now at the spot where he had been hit in the face with the knife. He absent-mindedly rubbed it with his thumb. It drew blood, causing Epikrates to twist his foot in surprise. This made a very loud rustling sound in the dry leaves he was standing on. What trick of the gods was this, to turn a sharp blade dull for a moment just as it struck him? ", "The leaves rustled once more as the messenger crept over dry leaves around the tree. Epikrates began silently climbing the large trunk. When he reached the height of two men, he looked down to see a shadowy figure carrying a bronze sword, glinting pale gold in the morning light.

She was beautiful. Her hand gently touched his, still holding the arrow to her heart, and she stopped smiling. The clouds parted suddenly to reveal the most glorious sunrise ever to be completely ignored, and a ray of light illuminated her eyes through the trees on the edge of the forest. Her pupils dilated. Their lips pressed together as Epikrates pressed the tip of the arrow against her skin, and ripped her tunic from the bosom down to the waist, where the shaft of the arrow broke. She laughed and took his knife from its sheathe, then thrust it into his chest, creating a slit into which she inserted both hands. They were writhing in the leaves, connected through various tears in their clothing. It was the best experience of either of their lives to date.

I would never be warm again.", "Sobbing, screaming, hysterically I lifted my rifle and I fired. Over and over again I fired until all I heard were clicks. Blindly I dropped my rifle.

My head hit the bottom of the bunk above me as the klaxon bells jolted me awake. Fuzzy specks of light filled my line of vision. Behind the specks, an upside down head and a long whip of blond hair appeared from above.\n\u201cDamn, Lorney. If you wanted your head in my ass all you had to do was ask.\u201d Katie slide gracefully from the top bunk and landed on her feet like the feline predator she thought of herself as being. I envied her poise but in exchange she, in all of her 5 feet and 2 inches envied my ability to reach the weapons on the top shelves without needing a box to stand on. I flipped her off with one hand while rubbing my head with the other. Everyone in the barracks jumped out of bed and started throwing on their gear. Ever since the Greater Depression caused a civil war in the continental United States, the country had devolved into 40 or so warring factions. Every state for themselves. People still talked about the \u201cUnited States\u201d but there was nothing united about them. I always had dreams of one day leaving Birmingham for a bigger city. New York City or Chicago. Somewhere not in the shadows of the Appalachian Mountains. Somewhere not in the South. Somewhere not so goddamn hot all the time. Now I\u2019m trapped here for the foreseeable future. After the war started, I was drafted into the Sovereignty of Alabama\u2019s militia. I\u2019m forced to risk my life protecting a land that I don't want to be in. Our commander started issuing instructions over the loudspeakers. \u201cATTENTION. Floridean forces detected. All personal report to the southern barricades and initiate defensive procedures.\u201d Our commander, an artificial intelligence program codenamed \u201cDixie\u201d drawled on in her robotic voice. Who knew a computer program could have a Southern accent? Her announcement began playing on a loop but was drowned out by the sound of soldiers gathering their weapons and running towards the door. \u201cLorney, get your ass in gear. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, everyone else\u2019s asses are all in gear. Even Charleston\u2019s ass is in gear and his left ass cheek got stabbed by a rogue from Atlanta last week.\u201d Katie\u2019s favorite word was \u201cass\u201d and sprinkled her speech with it like a fine seasoning. With the country falling apart and everything going to hell, her tough, fuck-with-me-I-dare-you attitude gets her through it all. She\u2019s a huge pain in my ass and I wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without her. She is also one of the few people I know that never took the HB Vaccine, the vaccine that ruined everything for everyone. 4 years ago, a group of jilted researchers who specialized in both neuropsychiatric sociology and occult rituals stumbled upon scientific evidence confirming the existence of soulmates. Building on their discovery, they were able to create a vaccine with the purpose of preventing heartbreak and bad relationships. An unintended side effect was that it also protected against physical hurt in addition to emotional pain. It was a miracle combination of science and the supernatural. The only caveat being that the vaccine was only effective against your one true soulmate. The world welcomed the medicine into its veins without any doubt or hesitation. Heartbreak always seemed like an inevitable part of the human condition, and humanity was primed to obliterate it. However, the dating rituals changed rapidly once the vaccinations started. Instead of dances, high schools began hosting fight clubs. Punch someone in the face and if it doesn\u2019t hurt them, you\u2019ve found your soulmate. Random people began attacking each other in streets, trying to find the person they were meant to be with. People stopped using dating websites and lost interest in online social networks. In 2044, Facebook became the official sponsor of the state of California, but when the company went under 10 years later, so did the state. Everyone underestimates the economic power of the lonely. Getting my ass in gear, as Katie politely requested I do, I threw on my weapons belt, chewed some standard-issue amphetamines from the bucket that was being passed around, and made my way outside. \u201cIt good and goddamn figures those asshole Florida Disneyland dickheads would come at us at the crack of ass when I was gonna have my first full night of sleep in a week.\u201d Katie bitched as she put on her helmet and leather jacket. The Sovereignty of Alabama didn\u2019t provide its soldiers with much in the way of protective gear, so a lot of us had to make do with what we could find. In her free time, Katie had embossed the back of her jacket with \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO READ THIS, THEN YOUR ASS IS GRASS.\u201d and the S. of A.\u2019s seal, except she drew over the image of the Vulcan statue with a Sharpie and made him into the Grim Reaper. We approached the southern barricade right as the sun started glowing over the horizon. We took our stations. Everything was still and almost quiet. Nothing but the sounds of cicadas and birds and the faint echo of Dixie about a mile back calling an empty barracks to attention. Minutes passed. I watched the guards in the towersas their eyes darted around looking for the first signs of whatever slime the Florida Republic scooped from the wetlands and sent to raid our camp. The FR forces were always trying to get into our camp but could never make it past the barricade. More time passed by. We were getting bored and restless. Some of the soldiers wandered off in search of a private place to take their morning piss. Some were vaping e-cigs and some were just sitting on the ground, staring into space. Suddenly, the guards started clambering down off the towers while shouting. \u201cEVERYONE GET BACK! THEY\u2019VE GOT A FUCKING MISSILE LAUNCHER! GET THE FUCK BA-\u201d ", "The rest of the story will be in the comments!", "As rare as it was for Paired to exist it wasn't impossible.

Regardless though, most people end up finding out accidentally...", "... ", "\nI sat in my fox hole thinking when a fire ball went off near by", "\"Oh shit!\" I screamed as I grab my staff and rifle one in each hand. I wave the staff in front of me and turn invisible, running down the trench. Running always running. Once I finally drop the spell out of the range of the artillery bombardment I drop to my knees and rest. I dig the staff into the ground and lay the rifle against it. This unholy war would be the death of my I was sure. Thats when I saw something jump over the wall and towards me", "She came out of no where and I felt an arm come flying with the rest of her and sock me right in the jaw, knocking us both to the ground. She's got a staff of her own and a pistol at her side, pointing the former's blade at my chest trying to drive it into my chest. Clutching it around the joining piece of the wood and metal, i see it slowly slip further and further towards my vital organs. I kick up and send her over my head and scramble for my own staff only to come to my feet staring down the barrel of her pistol. \n", " I lower my blade but still keep my muscles tense bcz I know what's coming next\n\"I'm sorry.\" ", " hammer striking metal and exploding a small ball of lead forward into my skull... except there is no bang... a misfire!", "I spin flicking my wrist and send the weapon flying engaging in melee with one another. She swings high I block. I swing low she actually kicks the strike away sending me off balance. A lightning bolt shoots from her blue crystal before her legs push her into the air towards me blade once again searching for my flesh. I dodge the crackling blue energy before parrying the attack into the ground on my left. Vines come and hold it still before I swing low again attempting to take her feet out from under her. Instead I come in contact with her now imbedded staff and the resulting release of energy sent us both flying across the battle arena and into a wall (her) and a wooden table/chair set near by (me) our weapons no where in sight. ", "When I wake up, I look around and feel a heat surrounding me. The table and chairs are now ash. The wood holding up what was once a trench is now gone and most of the trench itself having flowed its example. The water in the mud had all but evaporated and what sand and dirt remained was glowing a hot red. I looked around for my adversary, wondering how I survived such an intense explosion and then how had either of us survived?? She was doing something quite similar to me from the other side of the newly formed crater... No... it couldn't be. Not her. Not now. Why did it have to be here?!", "We both seem to come to the same realization, scream, and get up and charge each other making contact in the center of the barren circle", "Edit I meant war not way", "The light of the moon filtered through the tops of the trees, the thin forest surrounding me in my foxhole silent. My breathe came short and quick and my heart was pounding in my throat, though I still couldn't hear. I knew after the shelling came the men and the fear kept me jumping at shadows. Maybe these shadows were my minds creation, the unrelenting pounding of artillery had kept me up for the last two nights, but I had to keep jumping in case one of them turned out real. The only smell was the decay of my comrade, his right eye blasted out by a piece of shrapnel in the last barrage. I didn't have time to move him out and I wasn't sure I would have the opportunity to apologize to his mother for letting her son die.", "It took an eternity of minutes for the dark figures to begin moving through trees ahead and at the sight of them I panicked. I curled into a ball at first and covered my head with my hands, living in a world of blood rushing and hyperventilation. Some part of me, probably the part the army drilled into me, took over and mechanically pulled the corpse over myself. I began to play dead because I knew I would die if I didn't.", "The gunfire started very nearly after, the cracks breaking the painted scene of the night. It began to sound more like the fourth of July than any other firefight I had been in, maybe cause it lacked the explosions amd visceral visuals that normally accompanied. I would wager it took around ten minutes for the gunfire to peter out, but it is hard to tell when hiding like I was. I did my best to stay still and calm my breath, but my lungs begged for air and I had no choice but to acquiesce, though in an attempt to stay hidden I moved the body above my nearer to my face so maybe the steam wouldn't be noticeable.  The sound of crunching snow all around told me that people were passing by, almost certainly the enemy, but beyond several comments I couldn't understand, I had no interaction with these men.", "I waited, more patient than my mother ever was with me or my brothers, until I didn't hear anymore feet passing by and then waited some more. I became certain that they had all passed, convinced myself of it, and finally pulled the body off of my chest and pushed it to the side, thanking him as I did.  I crawled to the edge of the hole and peered above the snow, desperately searching for any enemy. I suppose I should have looked behind, towards where they went instead of where they came from, and I certainly shouldn't have just stood up, but as quickly as I stood, I heard a shout from behind me. I turned to see a man in one of the despised uniforms leveling his rifle at me. I fell on my ass, mind blank in the panic, but recovered as my enemies rifle jammed. Strange, but I didn't think much about it as I tried to chamber out of the hole. It didn't take long to get out, but it gave the adversary enough time to pull out his knife and near me. He lunged at my throat, certain to kill, and I said my apologies to my family and my god that I went out this way.  ", "We fell backwards into the foxhole and for a moment I was dead. Not truly, but convinced enough of my doom that I just lay back in the snowy den, eyes closed and refusing to breath. When I heard an exclaim of what was supposedly surprise, confusion entered and I cracked open my eyes. I was most definitely not dead and the man who straddled me, knife in hand, looked as confused as I felt. He attempted another plunge of the blade, but it just bounced off a bit, then continued along my side into the ground. ", "We both understood what was happening, but the disbelief of such a coincidence showed on his face as much as it must have shown on mine.  I had always denied this side of myself, not wanting to disappoint my mother who desperately wanted grandchildren, but the blatant truth of the matter forced itself upon me. My soul mate slowly stood and he walked away towards the other end of the hole, but I continued to lay in the snow, exhaustion overcoming the shock and confusion. I didn't want to continue, I just wanted to lay there and let the snow cover me,but the same instinct that pulled the corpse over me pushed me off the ground. ", "I chambered to my feet and turned to the man who was my match, the man who was exactly perfect for me, who would make me the most happy and I would make him the most happy. The Bible said that soul mates were just two halves of a single angel that found each other, but I didn't feel the happiness that should have accompanied the moment, the joy all the stories spoke of. My other half turned to face me and he started to say something in his native tongue, but I only knew its slurs so I understood nothing. He figured this out quickly and began to speak my language, broken but understandable.  He asked for my surrender, told me he would take me in and after the war we could live in peace.  I wanted the same, I knew I wanted it, but want does not a soldier make. I moved towards him and lightly kissed him, shocking him but he surprisingly didn't resist. Maybe it shouldn't have surprised me, but it did. I embraced him tightly for a moment, breathing him in more calmly than I should, and pulled away. As I pulled away, I lifted the pin from the grenade strapped on his chest. It took him a moment too long to realize I had, and the sadness in his eyes made me regret just a bit, but the duty of the soldier and the patriot held fast in my mind in my last moments.", "The first time I saw her was when I was 5, it was the big activity hall a few miles away, my parents took me and some of my classmates there occasionally if we got too messy in the house. I was running around with a foam sword, chasing Michael when I saw her, she was at the art table, I stopped for a moment but paid her no mind, I had no interest in girls after all, but she had this green paint smudged across her face in the cutest way. I ran after Michael, she turned from the table and ran towards me, scissors in hand after more craft paper. We crashed. Her mother came rushing over screaming \"Lila! What have I told you about running with scissors!\" she grabbed me, to see if I was hurt but there was nothing, the scissors had crumpled against my skin and her mothers face changed, she seemed happy, but shocked, I didn't understand, I pulled away and ran off into the sea of giggling children, thinking I would get in trouble. I didn't see either of them the rest of the day but her name still rang in my head. Lila. ", "Years passed and I never told anyone about the incident, I didn't think it mattered, people would talk about soul mates and love and she'd always be there in the back of my mind but I guess it never really clicked. I saw her again when I was 17, I was late, she was late, we crashed, again, in the middle of the street, knocking us both over. We didn't even spare a glance, I just gathered my dropped papers, mumbled a sorry and ran off, she did the same. It didn't even register until I got to class and looked at my papers. There amidst the pile was one I didn't recognise. The neatly scribbled handwriting, the faint smell of coffee, and there in the corner, a smudge of purple paint, it seemed to just be a shopping list but I held onto it, I carefully packed it into my wallet and went about my day in autopilot, still thinking about her and the more I did, the more it made sense. There was not a single scratch, bump, or bruise on me from the impact and though it was only a moment, I can still see her breathtakingly grey eyes and the hint of blue that danced around them. Michael mentioned that I had seemed unfocused that day but I brushed it off saying that I was tired, he left me to it and gave me a copy of his biology notes after class. ", "More years passed and I didn't see her, I joined the army along with some other classmates, I'd never been great academically, so it was that or office work and I'm not one to sit still. Our country fell into war with itself and the surrounding areas and I've honestly never felt more in my element. I was in my prime, leading my own team, doing what I loved. My squad along with a few others were to storm a town a few over from my own, it had been evacuated of innocents a few months ago and now only rebels remained. We split off, checking out each house as we went. We got to a small house on the 5th street, me and another went in to check it out while the rest of the groups did other houses. I cautiously made my way up the stairs while my buddy swept downstairs, everything was clear until I made my way towards the back room. As I entered I saw it. The smallest movement behind a bed, but I saw it. I slowly drew my combat knife and lunged at the same moment that they jumped at me, they were armed with nothing but a pen. We fell to the ground, both swinging our weapons, I swung for her stomach as the pen made contact with my eye. I lay there horrified at the lack of pain, I looked to my knife, only to see it crumpled in my hand, she raised her arm for another attack but hesitated, echoing my horror. There she was. 12 years since the last incident. The shopping list, ", " shopping list, still sitting in my breast pocket. Lila. She trembled slightly and the beginnings of a laugh escaped her thin, blood-soaked lips. In that fraction of a moment there was nothing else but us, I studied every detail of her heart shaped face and lost myself for what seemed like eons in her stormy eyes. Then it was over. ", "Michael had stormed into the room, seeing the bedraggled rebel on top of me, arm still raised. Without a second thought he shot her. Perfectly between the eyes, as he had been trained to do. I watched in slow motion as her skull caved in on itself and her delicate body slumped onto me. He shoved her off and pulled me up but I couldn't see him. I couldn't hear him yelling, asking if I was hurt, I couldn't feel him shaking me to snap me out of it. He had shot her. He was protecting me, but he had killed her, my soulmate. Lila. I couldn't blame him. He couldn't have known. He wouldn't have known. He was defending me. His best friend of over 25 years. But I could not look at him. I stared at her body on the floor and shot him. My squad had heard then gunfire and now entered the room, seeing the two bodies on the floor and me, gun in hand, covered in blood. I ordered them to continue the search. Leave me here. For a while they refused. I waved the gun in their faces and they eventually left. I crumpled to the floor.

Somebody had triggered a swathe of my detonation charges early.  That meant that Vaaslu forces either knew I was here at the mystery complex in the middle of the neutral zone, or they would know shortly.  I saw a figure through the smoke with my one good eye.  Lithe, white clad, no armor, body language indicating suprise.  A medic?  She darted towards a drawer, pulling the whole thing out in her haste and spilling the contents.  One small, heavy object in particular caught her attention as it thudded and skittered across the ground.  She dove for it.  By the time I had recovered my wits and regained my feet, she had found the grip of the revolver and rolled to a crouched position, leveling the weapon at my head.  The gun went off, the familiar pop of a snubnose echoing around the basement, the muzzle flash briefly illuminating the medic's face.  I saw a woman wearing an expression of determination and focus.  She was pretty, and she was well-trained.  Now I've dodged bullets before.  Being a Kendragi scout, alone in enemy territory, sabotaging enemy operations all the live long day, the reflex becomes second nature after a point.  But at this range, with so little time to move, burdened by my rifle and wound, I knew I couldn't move away in time.  So I made peace with it.  There were certainly uglier people in the world that had tried to kill me.  At least this woman had a face I could die happy looking at.  But the damnedest thing happened in the microseconds it took the round to cover the small distance between us.  I swear to whatever god strikes your fancy, the fucking thing curved up and around.  Whizzed right past my left ear and planted itself in the stone wall behind me, kicking up a healthy vortex of dust.  Were I a religious man, I would've spared a beat to \"thank my holy maker and taunt my undertaker\" as it were.  Fortunately, I'm not, because she had five rounds left to go, and squeezed them all out in short order.  Like I said though, it's a reflex a this point, and having recovered my wits, I managed to not get my head blown off.  The medic still had some surprises for me though.  She dropped the revolver, and had sprinted half the distance between us before it hit the ground.  I brought the rifle to bear, but as the stock settled into the familiar notch in my shoulder, the entire body gave a sudden twist, dislodging my grip, and clattered to the ground.  She was upon me now, having pulled some type of knife from a kit at the small of her back.  She channeled her momentum into a powerful thrust at my neck.  I swatted her wrist off target and grabbed her around the waist, turning my hips and countering her attack with a throw.  She went with it, tucking her head and landing on her feet.  We twisted and turned in towards each other, each striking and countering with practiced ease.  Each time I was sure a blow would land, I would only hit air, and likewise, she would throw these amazingly placed slashes that would glance off my armor.  Neither of us gave an inch of ground.  It was then that I noticed her knife.  The curved shape and rear-facing barbs seemed so familiar.  Ah, a Vassluon de-vester, carried by field medics to remove the armor of heavy units by severing the fibers that held the plates in place.  It was a versatile tool, though I'd never seen anyone use it like this.  She had four red stripes on the inside of her right bicep, indicating a high rank in some Vasslu martial art.  That explained it.  But even as I made the observation, the reason she would use such a weapon dawned on me far too late.  With one more cut beneath my armpit, the plate protecting my torso fell from its place, leaving me exposed.  Without the guarantee of safety from her small blade, the tide of the fight quickly shifted into her favor.  Counter, counter, make space, get close, avoid, dodge, back up.  My mind was on autopilot, what little cognitive function I had trying to find a way out of this encounter in which I was heavily outmatched.  She stepped between my legs, behind my heel, dropped into a crouch, and rammed her small shoulder into me with enough force to knock me off balance.  Briefly, I saw her framed in the light above us, shining through the big ass hole I had fallen through.  She was an avenging angel, a Seraphim from the Seat of the Thirteen Stars, sent to take my debt of flesh for all those I had wronged.  With a guttural cry of victory that lives in the throats of all predators, she leaped, coming down dagger first.  She was aiming for my heart.  Then the worst thing that could have possibly happened at that moment did.  She hit her mark.  And instead of ending me, a white light, brighter than even the golden rays behind her, bloomed from the point between us, stopping it.  Her hips crashed down onto mine, and we both stared at our light, comprehending, but not believing.", "When the Thirteen created man and woman, they saw that they would often wander apart, into the darkness where the primordial fears sat in wait.  Terror would shortly overcome them, and after a time, they would lash out at and kill anything that touched them, even those of their own kind.  Even the ones they loved the most.  To the Thirteen, the solution was simple.  In our times of greatest fear and trepidation, when we lose ourselves to terror, or anger, or sorrow, there will always be a light at the bottom to comfort us.  All we had to do was find our other halves.  Complete the circuit, and find relief.  The gods' most visible gift.", "We stared at our light, comprehending, but not believing.  Her pretty eyes met my one good one.  She rose, the very picture of grace, and the light faded.  She gestured around the room, which to this point I had not gotten a good look at, and for the first time, I saw cots.  Women and children stared back at me with undisguised apprehension.  This wasn't a Vasslu military training complex, it was a secret clinic, helping those displaced by our nations' war.  I looked back up at her.  She was breathing as heavily as I was.  She must have been a defector from the Vasslu special forces.  Now I could see the desperation and worry in her eyes more clearly.  There was a heavy pause as she bent down to examine the insignias on my discarded breastplate.  Kendragi scout, 50th company.   After another moment, she helped me up, and pointed to an unoccupied cot.  I sat myself down, and she pulled up a stool beside me and set to work on my eye.  The other one was busy staring at her.  \"I'm Vlak,\" says I, nervous as a schoolboy talking to his first crush.  She stares at me for a long second, then smiles.  \"Lylai.\"", "Three days into battle, my gear was half cover in blood from my enemies and friend from my unit. Only 12 out of 50 had survived the carnage, we regroup with survivor from the west unit and the medical response team that came looking to treat the ones that were left. In total we were about 60, all hidden in a cave form by a rock climbing from the underground on the valley at the beginning of the forest. This giant rock gave us shelter that night, no fire was lit, no food was cooked as nobody was hungry nor cold. It was just an share sense of shock and disbelief that we were all hiding in a cave that could be comfortable if we were only 20 or 15. There was barely room to move without touching anyone else. \nThe next morning, before the light of the day could completely dissipate the dark, while the world was in a gray state, I hear the horror in the voice of the medic running back to the cave, \"they found us!\" He was screaming while an arrow pierce his skull from the back to the middle of his forehead. Nobody was ready, the blades were on the side of the ones still sleeping and bows and knifes out of reach for the ones that were awake. About 45 of our enemies were in front of us and that giant rock that gave us shelter was now a tombstone for all of us. I went a reach for a flat piece of wood that had a branch to hold to it as a shield, took a blade that wasn't mine to get ready for battle. That's when I felt it, a knife flying straight into my eye, I covered my face with the wood, dropped the blade and went to instinctively pull the knife out, there was no pain, there was no blood. Confuse I grabbed my blade again, another 2 knife were already in the wood and by the time I saw past it she was already in front of my with sword in hand delivering blows to my shield, her yellow eyes were burning like fire as she was trying to unsuccessfully trying to split my head. I thought she did but nothing happened, she didn't kill me. Her face changed from rage to gracefully look m, she looked disturbed but at the same time happy in way that could hardly be seen but I felt it, I felt it too.\nIt was too quick, i saw it after I happened.

Have you made any friends?\" or \"Kevin, we're concerned about your grades.\"", "'Kevin' this, 'Kevin' that. He was always a quiet boy, kept to himself. Never had much of a chance to make friends. His dad was a two-star general, always assigned to some task force or another, always shuffled around. The constant moving had taken its toll on him. It's not that he was stupid, but his studies were a garbled mess. He knew things his peers weren't expected to know, and struggled with things he was expected to know but was never taught. He tried, he tried so hard, but he only ever scraped by with Cs.", "Making things worse, the bullies at school smelled his frustration and loneliness like flies around carrion. He was pushed around, taunted, pranked, and had malicious rumors spread all the time. He was used to it. He wasn't happy, but he was used to it.", "And yet, he'd constantly be called into the principal's office. Every school he went to. Why aren't making friends? Why are your grades so mediocre? Oh, and why did you set a bag of dog poop on fire? Why did you throw a stink bomb into the girl's locker room? Why did you threaten to kill the kindergartners?", "Apart from the first two questions, the inevitable follow-up questions were lies. At first the authorities would be somewhat understanding, and give him the benefit of the doubt. But his permanent record grew, and the adults grew less and less amicable as his reputation built up.

Kevin had always appreciated fire, to be sure. But what boy of his age didn't? There was something primal about lighting campfires with his dad, something beautiful about the sparks and flicking tongues of flame engulfing the wood. But it was a healthy respect for fire. Kevin was no pyromaniac.", "And yet fire began appearing in places he happened to frequent. Everywhere he went, fire followed. The police found no proof, but his parents sent him to a shrink, just in case. It all came to a head when, during one particularly boring literature class, he sneezed.

The Grand Society of North American Magicks cares little for the political borders laid by the Plivs, you see.", "Kevin's life seemed to turn around that day. He made friends. He proved to be a high performing student. He learned to laugh and smile. He became open to new experiences. If only he'd listened when the Duke dropped his second bombshell.

Or what used to be his head...", "Kevin wakes up from his slumber and hops out of bed. He grabs his wand and gets ready for the day. The look in his eyes says he's seen some stuff. Yeah, he'd taken care of some robbers with a little help from his natural gifts. That's how he was found supposedly, but he had never really excelled and barely passed his coursework. Now, the year was almost over and things had gotten weird with the death of a few, apparently beloved, students and staff.

He has learned some cool tricks, but that's all they are. He doesn't belong here. It's time to go home before things get really dangerous. Kevin turns to leave the bathroom when he kicks something on the floor. It's a bottle. He picks it up. There's a name on it, Felix Felicis. Kevin opens the top and smells it. It smells good and looks good. Kevin takes a drink of it, then downs all of it. ", "Kevin feels a lot better, more confident. He will have to apologize to Felix when he finds him.

", "Kevin has spent months exploring, and this time against these bad guys feels personal. He isn't sure why, but he knows it is. The witches and wizards fall right into his trap. Paint cans swinging on ropes take out five of them. He is able to sneak up on a few and drop tarantulas on them, taking out several of their own men when they try to get spiders off. Kevin crawls through the tunnels and little known spots. He is uncatchable. He doesn't need magic. He is better than magic. He rides a broom around the school swinging his paintcan at anyone who dares to oppose him wearing the sorting hat the entire time. Finally, the dude whose name can't be said because it is weird or hard to pronounce enters Hogwarts. Kevin feels a surge through his body and falls hard to the floor. ", "\"Nagini, finish this young fool.\"  ", "Kevin crawls back slowly away from the creature. The sorting hat talks to him. It tells him something that seems impossible, but he does it.

", "Listening, as he put it, was how Yavin liked to describe his mental talents. With the care born from years of practice, he pulled the relevant words and images from the air around his friend's mind and put them back together into a cohesive whole. They were always there, at least a little, but unless he payed attention it was more like an endless chatter, a sea of noise. He could always catch glimpses. But when he put his full attention to the task, another's mind was as easy to understand as a television set.

He dropped the images, watching them shatter in his mind like a plate of china. ", "\"Your turn.\" Del said, frowning. ", "Yavin went. Back and forth, they pushed the pieces around the board. Neither could get the advantage, until all at once Yavin found himself in check. ", "\"Hey! I thought you said you were going to lose!\" He said, shooting Del a dirty look. ", "\"You haven't lost yet, just look for a way out! You know the rules as well as anyone. Besides, you've gotten a lot better at Chess now that you stopped relying on your, uh, 'talents.'\"", " Yavin thought. Concentrating hard, he pretended to look at the board, and once again gathered his friend's stray thoughts into a readable whole. Yavin hated cheating, especially against his friend - but he hated losing even more. ", "From there, the game was completely one-sided. Yavin's knights, bishops, and queen leapt around the board, taking piece after piece from under Del's nose without ever losing ground. Slowly, Yavin began to smile, then grin openly. ", "\"It's so ", " He said. \"I wish I understood this well before!\" ", "\"Understood what?\" Del asked, smirking. ", "\"Nothing! Your go!\" Yavin replied quickly. Faster and faster they moved, taking turn after turn in only a few seconds. He was doing it, he was winning! So what if he couldn't stop to read every corner of Del's thoughts anymore, it was almost over, he had almost - ", "\"Check, and mate.\" Del said, smugly. \"You should have been paying more attention to the board, instead of my mind.

It was the most basic move that left more probable victories in his future.

Simon opened his eyes and saw that Kyle had moved and felt wetness on his above his lip. He reached up and felt the blood. He didn't understand what was happening.

Kyle was always a step ahead, he countered all the good strategies the crowd was thinking to themselves. Simon would occasionally try to read Kyle's mind but still found the noise overwhelming. It didn't take long for Kyle to check mate Simon.

Thirty-two hours into this final game of the world championship, his tie was off and empty espresso cups littered the nearby tables. He gave an immense yawn and shifted his knight. He looked across the board at his opponent, who sat back in his chair, a half smile on his face and his eyes closed. Arjun Chettiar looked the picture of serenity. He sipped his tea before taking Barry's rook with a bishop. It was the first piece to be taken in the entire game. Mr. Chettiar settled back in his chair and closed his eyes again.", "Staring intently at the board, Barry screamed internally. Had he been watching him, Barry would have seen Mr. Chettiar's half smile broaden. Many years ago, Barry had given his left testicle to a gypsy woman in exchange for the power of prophecy. At first it wasn't quite what he was hoping for. Visions would strike him at random, his eyes would roll back in his head and he would speak in tongues as everything from burning his toast next Wednesday to the eventual heat death of the universe flashed before his eyes. ", "This could happen at unfortunate times. When he was in the middle of giving his quarterly budget report to the senior manager from corporate, he collapsed and wet himself. Now, if Barry merely had had an epileptic seizure, which is roughly what this looked like, it would have been an understandable to everyone involved. But unfortunately, a rather sweaty Barry woke up screaming that the senior manager needed to stop his affair with the secretary because his wife was about to find out. Because future and present could get a little muggy in his visions, Barry did not know that the senior manager's wife was a doctor, and that the senior manager was on the phone asking her what to do about his convulsing employee when Barry somewhat involuntarily gave him this advice. Almost immediately Barry had a vision of himself in underpants on a couch for the next six months, but he didn't really need any special powers to see that coming. ", "It was a hot day in July and sitting on his couch wearing nought but a metallica t-shit, underpants, and a god-awful beard, 36-year-old Barry was playing with a penny. He tossed a coin, caught it, slapped down onto the back of his hand. He tried to guess which side came up. Half the time this ended with him waking up on the floor not 100% sure if it was heads or tails, but was absolutely certain how several random strangers would die. His mind had now visited a lot of nursing homes. But the other half of the time, just a moment before he peaked underneath his hand, he had a vision of peaking underneath his hand, but he didn't even blink. No eye rolling, no shaking, no peeing himself. Barry reached down and unstuck the excess scrotum from his left leg. Maybe he could make it worth it after all. ", "After several years of training, Barry was able to choose what he wanted to see in the future and visualize it at will. After making millions gambling on everything from horse-races and NFL games to who would win the dwarf toss at his local titty bar, Barry was bored. Then he stumbled onto chess. He knew he was cheating, but he found people respected him as an intellectual when trounced nineteen year old's named Dmitri and Hao who were \"prodigies\". It was better than being shouted at by casino managers that couldn't figure out how he was beating the house at roulette. The world of chess weren't exactly his usual crowd, but having the admiration of millions of people was nice. Even if they were probably mostly on the spectrum. ", "Now that was about to be taken away from him. Ever since his match with Mr. Chettiar began, his visions of the game would be immediately followed by a sharp, lightning-fast headache, and when he next peaked into the future to see what he would need to do next, the game had changed completely. Neither he nor his opponent had gained any advantage until now. He was losing. How could Barry lose? He was losing focus. Every once in a while, his vision of the boards position 12 moves from now would be interrupted with images of someone winning the lottery, or of a couple on their first date, then becoming engaged, then having children, then dying peacefully surrounded by their numerous children and grandchildren. Then Barry looked up and saw it. Mr. Chettiar was wiping away a tear. Their eyes met. Mr. Chettiar went from looking like someone watching the opening seen of Up for the first time, to a 12 year boy caught on the parts of the internet he is not meant to see.\nSuddenly, Barry remembered. For the price of his right testicle and an adrenal gland, the gypsy had offered to give him the ability to read minds as well! That tricky little witch. Barry made a mental note to contact his elected representative about stricter immigration laws. ", "Mr. Chettiar scowled at him.", "Then it hit Barry. All he had to do to win was think such putrid, unpalatable thoughts that Mr. Chettiar would simply stay out of his head!", "Barry recalled a bowel movement he had had after the night he ate 4 lbs of suicide hot wings. \nMr. Chettiar cringed.", "Barry took one of his pawns and blocked Mr. Chettiar's line of attack. \nMr. Chettiar looked shocked.", "Barry imagined Mother Theresa pegging the Pope. \nMr. Chettiar looked more shocked. He fumbled with his rook, trying to regain ground.", "Barry imagined Mr. Chettiar's own mother having relations with a goat. \nMr. Chettiar almost let out an audible cry. ", "Barry took his knight.", "Ruthlessly, using every ounce of imagination he could muster, Barry conjured a picture of Donald Tump \"grabbin' 'em by the pussy\".", "Mr. Chettiar laid down his king.", "[removed]", "\"Up for a game of chess?\" He asked. There was no point in asking, but it was nice to be polite.", "\"What do you think?\" She replied. Unlike him, She didn't bother with politeness. Truth be told She found that it became quite grating after a while. And they had been working together for a long, long while.", "\"Must we really do this?\" He sighed. Playing with her meals was something She relished. This trait was simultaneously endearing and terribly irritating. For example, She knew that he knew that She already knew the answer to her question and yet she asked it anyways. If He didn't put a stop to it now, they'd be here all night talking in circles. .", "\"Of course not,\" She said with an overly exaggerated frown, \"but it doesn't hurt to be polite.\"", "\"No no, it's always good to be polite,\" He said, glaring daggers at her while He set up the board. Why did She enjoy being so difficult? He understood that her power made it difficult for her to take any conversation seriously, but did She really have to be so annoying?", "\"Yes, I do,\" She replied, the firelight reflecting her grin, making her look like She wasn't  all there. Truth be told She probably wasn't.", "He sighed deeply before asking,\"Black or white?\"", "\"Does it really matter?\" she asked.", "\"Not really,\" She replied before taking a seat on the white side of the board. One good thing He'd say about her is that She had wonderful taste in furniture.", "\"Thank you,\" She said before taking the seat opposite to him, \"After you my dear.\"", "He closed his eyes as He dove into a river of infinite possibility. With a quiet laugh She opened her mind and dove in after him.", "\"What are they doing?\" The Boy asked, pointing to the two figures silhouetted by the roaring fireplace. They'd been sitting there for the better part of an hour with the same look of intense concentration on both their faces.", "\"Playing chess,\" The Man replied.", "\"But they haven't made any moves,\" The Boy said, a puzzled expression forming on his face.", "\"They have their own way of playing chess,\" The Man replied ,\"I've found that it's best to not question it.\"", "\"Checkmate,\" He said with a smug, satisfied smile. It was the kind of smile that takes years of practice. The kind of smile that would send the most patient monk into a frothing rage.", "Not being remotely patient or monk-like, She promptly stood up and flipped the table sending the pieces flying through the air before they clattered on the floor below.", "\"You cheated,\" She spat, voice full of venom.", "\"Of course I didn't,\" He replied. Where would the fun be in that?", "Despite his ability, Mark always paced before a match. He glanced at the clock over the door, his eyes picking out the darkest minute hand amongst the shadowy movements of the second hands. A pen flew around the knuckles of his right hand before spinning across to his left. \"I am calm,\" he said to the room. ", "\"I didn't say you weren't, Mark,\" the other figure in the room responded from his position against the countertop, watching the pen's path. \"I'll never understand how you do that.

Good life lesson. Where do you want to be, Seth? Get the door.\"", "Seth started. \"Wha-\" but was interrupted by a knock on the door. His head swivelled back and forth between the door and Mark, who was putting on his jacket. Seth glanced back one more time as he opened the door. ", "\"Five minutes,\" the woman said, looking into the room at Mark. \"Please head to the stage.\" Seth nodded to her, but she was already down the hall.", "He turned and grinned. \"Showtime. Let's see what you can do.\" The pair headed the opposite way the woman had gone, Mark still fiddling with his jacket. ", "\"How's my tie?\" Mark asked, stopping.", "Seth turned, a step ahead, and furrowed his brow. \"You're not wearing-\"", "A young man barrelled out of the cross corridor a foot behind Seth, slamming into the opposite wall. He was grinning, and tried to continue down the hall past the two, but security guards were right on his heels. ", "As they carried the intruder away from the cross corridor, laughing about it being a joke, Mark glanced down \"So I'm not. Good. Don't like them anyway.\" He turned down the hallway the man had come from, the bustle of the backstage area ahead. ", "Seth caught up, still confused. \"Why do you need a PA, anyway?\"", "Mark straightened a shirt sleeve within the jacket and slowly exhaled, unsure of how to answer. As he opened his mouth, he repeated the words he heard himself say. \"Because I'm the greatest chess player in the world.\" He grinned. \"I need someone to think one move ahead for me.\"", "Across the building, Joshua sat, eyes closed, breathing in... and out. Three times in and out through the nose, then in through the nose and out through the mouth. Repeat. On his third cycle, the corner of his mouth twitched upward. \"Stop it,\" he said. The girl on the counter looked at him innocently, though he couldn't see that with his eyes closed. She arched an eyebrow, and he flinched.", "\"Stop that,\" he hissed. He took an off pattern breath, trying to resume, and then bolted up, eyes flying open, arms in front of him. \"Hey!\" he yelled, but she just grinned at him. He held the pose for a second before relaxing, and laughed. \"You little... but he won't be able to fake me out like that. He'd have to know, you know... that...\" She nodded, but circled her hand for him to continue. He sighed. \"I should still focus on the game. Make good moves. I ", " a decent chess player, you know. No, no, no, that was in ", "! You haven't beaten me since then. No, that one doesn't count, I ", " you win that one. Well, your fish had just died, I couldn't think of anything else to do.\" Her face, quietly mocking, now split with silent laughter, her hands raised and shaking back and forth. \"See? It got your mind off it for a while, and now you can laugh at it. If I'd let you mope - someone's here.\"", "There was a knock at the door, and Joshua opened it a moment later. \"Five minutes,\" a young woman said, looking at Joshua and then the girl. \"Please make your way to the stage.\"", "\"Thank you, miss,\" Joshua replies. The woman glanced back at him from her clipboard, and then to the girl again before continuing down the hall. He turned, grinning. \"Ooh, she ", " you, Phoebe.\" The girl's eyes widened, mouth agape. \"The dress brings out your eyes - that little glimpse and she saw your ", ".\" Phoebe had crossed the room and smacked his arm. \"Ow!\"", "He rubbed the stinging mark as they walked down the hall. \"She really did like you, though,\" he started, for which he got smacked again. \"Hey! I mean, did you see the way she looked at you? Should I put on my big brother cap?\" She blushed, which just made him laugh harder. \"Some things don't take a mind reader, you know.\"", "The man introducing them droned on about their previous records, their mastery of the strategies of the ancient Persian game, which devolved into the history of the game including the derivation of its name and the phrase checkmate. The people here were chess fans, and wealthy chess fans at that, so the speech was mostly overkill, though he was quite verbose in thanking them all for their donations. ", "\"Today's event will award a prize of $10,000 to the charity of the winner's choice - Mark Booth plays for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America in honor of his father Richard, who is in stage 5 of the disease, while Joshua Pettis plays for the National Association of the Deaf for his sister Phoebe, a sweet bright girl who is unable to speak due to a defect in her vocal chords. Now, ladies and gentlemen - your players!\"", "The two men entered from different sides of the stage, waving to the gently applauding crowd. They met at center stage and shook hands, posing for the various cameras capturing their first time together. The master of ceremonies ushered them to the table, over which hung a camera, relaying the table position to the crowd. ", "Joshua closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then smiled at his sister in the front row. He locked eyes with his opponent, and then down at the board, and reached for a piece. ", "Mark pulled the pen from his pocket and began spinning it. As Joshua's eyes slid to the board, Mark watched the shadow of his opponent's arm reach for the piece, while his arm stayed put by his side. As the shadow reached, other fainter shadows played across the board, moves further down the road. When the shadow hand approached the piece, he began looking for the next moves, but they stayed faint. Until the shadow touched the piece.", "The shadow seemed to explode into a thousand different shadows, each moving a different piece in a different direction, each as strong as the others. The shadows moved and writhed around each other, changing positions, arm placement flickering. And then it was all gone. Mark stared wide eyed at the unmoved pieces before him as the pen clattered to the stage beside him.", "Just before his hand touched the pawn, Joshua jumped up from the table, knocking back his chair, just missing the table. He stumbled, dizzy, but stayed upright. The crowd gasped, but Joshua didn't hear them, his attention solidly on Mark, who still stared at the board.", "Slowly, Mark shifted his gaze to Joshua. The master of ceremonies cautiously approached. \"Is... is everything okay?\"", "\"Everything is fine,\" they said simultaneously. \"Better than... fine.\" Joshua winced at their echoing voices and righted his chair. He reached for a piece again, and nearly vomited at the intense nausea that swept over him. ", "The dancing shadows around Joshua fascinated and frightened Mark. For as long as he could see beyond the now, there had been one shadow, which was followed by another, and another, and another... He could see the path people would walk before they took the first step, hear his own words before he spoke them. Sometimes he wasn't sure where his own thoughts came from sometimes. Where did the words they both just spoke come from? ", "\"The... shadows...\" Joshua spoke through teeth clenched against the nausea. His head spun, vertigo threatening to overtake him. Mark looked into his eyes, and the shadows stopped. Joshua gasped at the sudden release, and then hurriedly moved a piece. Mark looked at the board, moved the same piece, and back to his opponent. ", "\"Draw?\" he asked, extending his hand. \"I think I've had enough chess for one... life.\" ", "Arron was on the verge of choking while silently laughing to himself about the comment. Of course, the barista had no idea that his scathing condemnation of Arron's mid-day eating habits had been overheard.", "\"You're right,\" Arron chuckled, \"I am getting a bit old for these sorts of sweets.\"", "The barista looked confused for a moment, but then smiled and offered, \"I get it! Our parents wouldn't let us have them when we were little, so now's the chance to make up for lost time!\"", "That was the toughest thing about being able to read minds, Arron thought: being constantly faced with the fact that women, who were otherwise cordial and pleasant, had thoughts of utter repulsion at the idea of him sexually. And that their thoughts, which they believed were private, were echoed clearly in Arron's mind. Sometimes he had to force himself to remember that they weren't trying to be rude--people's minds were their own space, and he knew it made no sense to get upset at something they believed no one else was privy to. ", "Quite to the contrary, Arron often felt ashamed by his ability to read minds. He felt like he was some sort of pervert, or that using his \"gift\"--though it often felt like a curse--was somehow immoral. Unfortunately, his newfound career, and the reason for his fame, was the area of his life where his feelings of guilt about using his ability were concentrated the greatest. Arron had become a chess hustler, and some people claimed he was the best player in the world. He would tell you, of course, that he was only as good, or perhaps slightly better, than whoever he was playing against.", "Arron exited the coffee shop and walked briskly toward the event hall a few blocks away. He was scheduled to play the first of 5 exhibition games against the current world champion, Aur\u00e9lien Ch\u00e9reau. FIDE, the World Chess Federation, was sponsoring the event in an attempt to use Arron's recent Youtube fame as a way to bring some attention to chess in a younger audience. ", "A video had gone viral a few months prior of Arron beating some notable masters in what they call a \"simultaneous\" match. Arron played white on each of ten boards, against ten opponents, and he did so while blindfolded. He went on to win 8 of the games, and drew the other 2. No one in the chess world had ever heard of Arron Mortinson up until that point, and the scene exploded with curiosity after the video went live. At 51, Arron had never considered the possibility of being \"internet\" famous. He figured the closest he would ever get would be as a meme, in the event that he did something incredibly stupid that just so happened to be caught on camera. ", "As Arron passed the people on the street, he tried his best to lose track of all the thoughts he was brushing up against. When he had first learned about his quirk, he dreaded the idea of going into public spaces. Arron was afraid that all the thoughts would coalesce, and his head would explode. As it turned out, and much to his benefit, quite the opposite was true. Because of the sheer volume of input, it was very difficult to focus on any particular thought. The mass of mind whispers became a sort of quiet jazz, and though Arron didn't enjoy it, he thought it strictly superior to the alternative.", "Arron opened the door to the event hall and was greeted by a stocky man in a blue suit who had a clear ear-piece in his right ear.", "\"Hello, Mr. Mortinson! My name is David, and I am here to escort you to your position back stage. Since you're a bit late, the audience has already been seated. We've moved your public meet and greet to take place after today's games instead.\"", "Arron didn't like meeting with fans. Sometimes someone would ask him too many questions about the game of chess, which would make him nervous since he actually wasn't that great at it. Or, much to his surprise, he would sense thoughts about how he must be retarded or autistic in order to have learned the game so quickly. In the case of the latter, Arron's discomfort stemmed from the fact that in a way, he felt they were right. He hadn't always been able to read minds, and the fact that he was now had him worried about his mental health.", "After shaking Arron's hand, David motioned forward, \"Mr. Mortinson, please follow me.\" ", "They walked down the elegantly carpeted hallway to the rear of the performance hall. Arron could hear the murmurs of a crowd and enjoyed the sensation of being able to hear the same collection of voices that David could. Ironic, Arron thought, that at this exact moment, he and this security guard were likely about the same skill level at chess. And yet, in a few minutes, when he was on the stage, Arron would be one of the best players on the planet. There was a beautiful metaphor for life hidden somewhere in that thought, but Arron couldn't quite place it.", "\"Mr. Mortinson, right through this door is the entrance to the stage. The stage manager will greet you and tell you when to walk to your chair. Do you have any questions?\" David asked.", "\"No sir. Thanks for keeping the bad guys at bay out there!\" Arron chuckled.", "David didn't.", "Arron walked over to the door and pushed the handle down; it was heavier than he had expected. He closed his eyes and pulled gently, listening to the increasing sounds that escaped through the growing crack in the auditorium wall. With the door all the way open, Arron could see the stage clearly. A woman with a black headset on walked frantically in his direction. ", "\"Hi, Arron Mortinson! What a pleasure to meet you! I'm Gwen, the stage director. Please follow me.\" she requested.", "As Arron moved forward to the edge of the black curtain which divided the audience from the preparation area, he shot a glance to his opponent, Aur\u00e9lien Ch\u00e9reau, who was already seated at the large ornate board in the middle of the stage. Aur\u00e9lien was staring directly at Arron, with a gaze that could have killed Medusa. ", "Gwen spoke softly to Arron, \"Alright, everything is ready for you. The representative from FIDE will go over the rules of the event with the audience as you make your way out to the board, and get comfortable. After he is finished speaking, a bell will ring, and then you will shake hands with Mr. Ch\u00e9reau and begin the match. Any questions?\"", "Arron shook his head, still feeling uneasy about his opponent's stare.\nGwen gestured forward, \"OK, then. Good luck!\"", "The moment Arron appeared from behind the curtain, the crowd started to applaud and holler. He could feel their thoughts start to flood into his mind--it was a bizarre feeling Arron had come to enjoy. Amidst the thought wisps were the usuals: those about his appearance, his height, his shoes, etc. Of course, there were skeptics and cynics that were convinced the Youtube video was just a ploy, and that Arron had no chance. And then there were cheers in the mind space from people who had come to witness what they believed would be a chess miracle. ", "As his steps grew closer to the center of the stage, Arron noticed something quite unusual and disorienting: the \"thoughtscape,\" as he called it--his sort of visualization for what he read from people's minds--was getting smaller. He stopped for a moment and quickly glanced around the room. When Arron's eyes caught those of Aur\u00e9lien's, he noticed a smirk slowly peel across the face of the champion. Arron took a few steps closer and noticed the whispers start to fade away.", "Finally, Arron took his seat at the table. He felt as though he had been spun around about three dozen times on a tire-swing. For the first time since the incident, Arron couldn't perceive any thoughts that weren't his own. He was confused, and terrified. ", "Aur\u00e9lien leaned forward and gestured Arron closer with a finger. Arron hesitantly complied. ", "\"You have no idea how long I have been waiting for this.\" Aur\u00e9lien hissed.", "The two men prepare for the epic game of chess...", "Mind reader - (I know exactly what he is going to do, I'm going to crush him)", "Both stare at each other in silence", "Clairvoyant man - \"You win\"", "Both go to a bar, have some beers and discuss world domination. ", "\"That's your plan?\"", "\"Once I look forward, it always goes that way. The course is set, we just have to move the pieces\"", "\"But why?\"", "\"If I knew the answer to that question, I wouldn't be playing chess. Shall we begin?\"", "\"You're the one playing white.

It was supposed to reflect the greatest accomplishment of your youth - to give you something to reflect on as you grew, and a bar to exceed as you built a life.  It was a tradition left over from a very long time ago, when we considered people adults at thirteen, and twenty-one was something like middle age.  As the world got more complicated, and safer as well, the twenty-one year old villagers were barely adults.  We'd had precious little chance to accomplish anything, and the titles were becoming something else - even shameful, in some cases.  ", "I watched as the line moved forward.

All who were older had stood there fearing something similar, and all who were younger feared it for themselves.

No one would jeer a strange, or pathetic title, but many would congratulate a commendable one. ", "The saddest case was right in front of me.  Alan.  Poor Alan, who had the worst luck.  I don't just mean the title - I mean his life, which led up to his title, \"Alan:Survivor-Against-Long-Odds\".  If anything bad could happen, it happened to Alan.  The illnesses, the accidents.  Which were almost as bad as the 'accidents'.  His parents had been real angels (before they'd had an accident of their own, and gone there), but not the kind you'd find in Heaven.  Things had gotten better for Alan after that, and he'd gone to live with his Aunt.  He had fewer bruises and 'fell down' far less often these days, but he still tended to flinch at a loud noise.  It's a small village, everyone knew what was going on, and pretended they didn't.  I had half hoped someone would get the title, 'Most-Self-Deluded'.  ", "I knew all about Alan and had guessed roughly what his title would be. and I knew what my title was going to be too.  It was pretty easy to guess, if you had actually accomplished something - few of us had more than one significant accomplishment.  I had been dreading this for three years.  I even thought about running.  I thought of refusing the Ceremony, and enduring the ostracism that would result.  I though of running a way to another village or town, and lying about my title, or pretending to be from one of the growing number of places that had discarded the practice altogether.

I walked past Alan and his now-permanently-memorialized tragedy, past John and his superlative.  I marched resolutely past poor Harold, who would never live this down, and past Jennifer, the only one of us with a title really worth having.

At sixteen, she'd already had a Masters Degree in Neurobiology. By nineteen, she had two Ph.D.'s and had found a cure for AIDS.

Instantly, there was a bustle from the camera crews hired to get live coverage of the event. The entire city began to murmur excitedly as she walked up to Glenda, eager to get her title. This was it, the moment she'd been working towards her entire life.", "She stood in the spotlight of one hundred cameras and billions of pairs of eyes staring at her. There were murmurs again, but this time, they were softer, more subdued. Almost like gasps.", "\"A list of achievements most impressive.\" Glenda said, her voice rattling the stage. \"But the most recent is the one for you.\"", "Lily thought about her achievements, smiling to herself when she realized what it would be. Lily, Rescuer of Aboriginal Village. ", "Glenda smiled as well. The entire world, watching from each and every corner, smiled as well.", "\"Lily.\"", "\"Receiver of Most Public Attention For Her Beauty.\"", "I kissed my mother goodbye, as I headed off to begin the trek that would surely mark the end of my life. She was trying, and failing, not to cry. So was I. We lived a mile away from town because of her 'gifts', close enough to be within reach, far enough away to keep seperate from the'decent folk'. \"She lived\", I mentally corrected, there was no way I would be allowed to return. I pondered what would happen to her briefly, then I shook myself of it, sure she could heal, even bringing people back from their deathbed, but there would always be those, like on THAT night. I turned away, unable to bear the thought a moment longer I shouldered my bag with the day's provisions, and strode off trying to ignore Mother's strangled sob. As I walked I briefly considered her name, and the horror story that she told me was her titling day. Miranda, Summoner of the Spirits, she told me it was an accident, she had been apprenticed to the bookseller and she had peeked in a book she ought not have and next thing she knew she had passed out on the floor, it wasn't for another five years on her titling day that anyone had realized that she housed a spirit of healing. Despite it's purity and usefulness, she was cast out as a witch, even through she was engaged to and pregnant by the mayor's son. One day we had hoped to move to a castle city, where 'gifted' people were welcome, but that's the funny thing about poverty. No one cares what money you could make, only what you had. It was about noon when I stopped to eat my lunch and take a swig of water before moving on, I was nearing the edge of the village. I wondered briefly what they would have done if I had not presented myself, probably brought the old coot to my, although it wasn't really necessarily required that my prescence be there for her to announce my title, I really didn't want them to send soldiers out to my mother's hut and put her at risk. I was at the door now. I took my last breath of pure, clean, free fresh air, and stepped inside. Glenda, Devourer of 53 Chicken Nuggets in One Sitting, was hunched over asleep. I prodded her cautiously. She sprang up, grabbed my face and looked into my eyes. I was reliving THAT night. A man. The smell of alcohol. The door swinging in the wind. Me, running in. Him, over my mother. Her blacked eye. I saw red. Then everything faded, I was looking at Glenda, the crazy old coot, as she wrote my title down in the pages of the registry. I saw her lips move and I ran out of the building, down the streets. I reached the hut by nightfall, I've never run so fast. I burst in, Mother was at the table. \"Micah...\", I gasped inbetween gulps of air, \"Micah..... Bringer of Justice\". For the second time that day we both shamelessly cried.", "\"Ah yes, you shall be known as John, Traveler of Forty Shoe Stores.\"", "The line was thinning out now. I peeked ahead to where John was breathing a sigh of relief. 'Shoe stores' was harmless. You could still get a job with that on your resume.", "The next student walked forward, Becky I think. She was wearing a long sleeved sweatshirt and nervously tugging at the sleeves with her hands.", "The village elder Glenda smiled and ushered her forward, putting on the same melodramatic voice that made her words echo through the amphitheater. \"Becky, on your twenty-first birthday, I see your entire life flash before me.\" With a puff of incense the seer closed her eyes, putting one hand on her temple and waving the other around in a way that felt as mystical as a stage magician. \"From this day forward, you shall be known as... Becky, Owner of Seven Cat Habitats!\"", "Becky seemed relieved, if a little embarrassed, and headed down to the audience once again. You'd think people in this town would have better things to do than watch the daily ceremonies at sunset, but it was a pretty packed house today. I looked into the crowd and saw my own parents: Tom, the Destroyer of Alcoholic Beverages, and Mary, the Only Survivor of Math Camp. They were both beaming proudly, and waved at me.", "\"My my, Steven, you shall be known as: The Man with Fifty Fetishes!\" The crowd started to laugh, and Steven turned bright red as he ran out of the stone circle.", "My turn next. Glenda, Devourer of Fifty Three Chicken Nuggets in a Single Sitting, eyed me up and down. \"Amy, my dear, come closer. There's no reason to be frightened.\"", "I don't think I looked particularly frightened, more indifferent, but this was all part of Glenda's show. That being said, if she was going to put a tagline on every novel I ever wrote, it had better be a good one.", "\"Oh, I see great things in your future, but the titles I give are based on the here and now. From this day forward...\"", "Something had just occurred to me. Why was Glenda's title so mundane?", "\"You shall be known as...\"", "Weren't seerers given their powers at birth?", "\"Amy: Disprover of Fraudulent... Potatoes.\"", "Glenda seemed upset, and she ushered me off the stage quickly. The audience didn't know how to react to my new title, and to be honest I was a little confused myself.", "Someone in the crowd spoke up. \"Um, Glenda, did you mean fraudulent politicians?\"", "Glenda paused. \"Yes, yes, of course! What did you think I said? Anyway, that's enough for today, I shall see you all on the morrow!\" Glenda bowed and spun through her fine silk curtains, before high tailing it across the fields at a breakneck pace.", "\"There are a lot less people here than I thought there would be.\"", "\"How many people were you expecting?\"", "\"About 9 or 10.\"", "\"This village has, like, 1,000 people.\"", "I was really nervous.

HOW ARE YOU ALREADY OUT?\"", "\"Easy lmao. She said hi, gave me a biscuit, told me my title, I pissed off.\"", "I swear if I didn't know him I'd call him a smartass. It looked like it's my turn. I walked into the room where Glenda waited.", "It was a spacious room, and seemed almost like a small civil courthouse, but it gave the appearance of being in a Senate hearing. Red and maroon everywhere, which made the chestnut wood chairs seem right at home. I walked up the aisle, taking it all in, when I saw her.", "\"Hello there Bryan. It's time to find out your name. Have a biscuit.\"", "I took a biscuit, but I couldn't eat. My stomach was kind of uncomfortable. Why? It's not like this'd matter in the long term. Ugh.", "\"I'm not gonna waste too much time, but I always ask, what do you expect your name to be?\"", "\"I have no goddamned clue.\"", "Glenda smirked and looked directly at me.", "\"Normally, Bryan, I explain the person's title after they get it. But this time, I'll tell you first. I know how your high school experience changed you. You didn't feel worth it.\"", "Now I REALLY wanted to throw up.", "\"But you persevered. Through all the crap people gave you. You were a sad soul, hell maybe you still are. But you never gave up on yourself.\"", "What was she talking about? I totally did. I almost committed suicide.

Aren't boys like me MEANT to do that?\"", "A tear found itself at my eye. To this day, I don't know if it was from happiness from being understood, or sadness from not realising that my experiences weren't meant to be normal.", "At least I got a bitchin' title out of it.", "This isn't part of the story, but please support people with depression and help to combat suicide.

Had anyone walked in on him, they would have seen what could only have been described as a dishevelled maniac hacking away at the laptop. However, Michael was far from crazy, he was determined. The naming ceremony was tomorrow, and although he had managed to do countless deeds of worth in his life, tonight\u2019s would be his greatest accomplishment to date.

How can I be of assistance?\u201d it responded.\nMichael was giddy with excitement, spending the next few hours testing E-V on different kinds of commands from opening files to creating complex algorithms for cyber-warfare, all while it maintained a pleasant conversation with Michael. He was pleased to note that it passed in every aspect. His stomach growled loudly, he had not eaten all day and now that he was down, was absolutely famished. \u201cE-V, find a take-out place and order me some food.\u201d He said smugly.\n\u201cE-V, do you have any preference, sir?\u201d it responded.\nMichael felt as if he were floating on cloud nine, \u201cSurprise me.\u201d", "In half an hour of chatting later, the doorbell rang. Michael the laptop down and placed it in his satchel. ", ". As he opened the door, a small man in orange clothes and hat stood on the other side with a small plastic bag. \u201cDelivery for Michael, no title?\u201d he said.\n\u201cYeah, my naming ceremony is tomorrow.\u201d \n\u201cOh I see, big day huh? Done anything worthwhile.\u201d The delivery man smirked, giving Michael a gentle nudge and a wink.\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll see. No worries.\u201d Michael said as he paid the man, bidding him goodnight.\nHeading into the kitchen, he opened the plastic bag and container that was inside. It had seemed that E-V had ordered some well-known Chicken Masala, ", " He thought to himself, happily gorging down his meal. In minutes, he had felt as stuffed as a pig and happily made his way to bed.", "The next morning, he awoke to the sound of his sister knocking on his front door. \u201cMichael? Come on, you\u2019re going to be late!\u201d she called from outside.\n\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d Michael said groggily as she stumbled out of bed, struggling to put his clothes on. His stomach produced a sickening gurgle that stopped Michael in his tracks. \u201cOh shit!\u201d he said louder this time with a sense of urgency. He bolted to the bathroom and spent the next ten minutes doing unspeakable things to his toilet, agony rang out in his voice with each passing minute, the smell alone would require a special team to come and quarantine the area. \u201cMichael?\u201d his sister called out once more.\n\u201cComing! Give me a minute!\u201d he yelled desperately. I can\u2019t miss the ceremony! He thought, grabbing the toilet paper. In one swift wiped he checked the toilet paper, completely blank. He wiped again, the same results. \u201cOh thank god!\u201d he whispered as he pulled up his pants and put on his best clothes. In a few minutes he was outside, his sister already waiting in the car. \u201cHurry up!\u201d she yelled.", "When they arrived at the ceremony, everyone was already in line for their new titles. Michael found his friends in line, his parents waiting in the crowd, tears of joy in their eyes. People surrounded them as far ahead on a raised stage was Glenda, the village elder. Michael stood in line and waited for his turn. A girl was already knelt in front of Glenda, who raised her hands and looked into the sky, \u201cGeorgia, ", ".\u201d The crowd cheered and laughed as Georgia stood up bashfully.\nThe names continued on an on, Ivan, ", ", Anna, ", ", and so forth. Finally, Michael\u2019s turn was up. As he held his head high, he strutted down the aisle. Everyone suddenly becoming silent as quiet whispers wondered what his title would be. Michael was still smiling smugly as he knelt before Glenda. Glenda moved her hands vaguely around him. \u201cYes\u2026Yes! I see\u2026I see, such achievements!\u201d she announced, the crowd murmured louder in curiosity. \u201cBut one that outshines all others!\u201d the crowd getting even louder, barely able to control themselves.\n\u201cI present ", "\u201d\nMichael thought to himself, this is it! This is my legacy!", "\u201c", "\u201d Glenda shouted.", "The crowd was dead silent; Michael did not dare raise his head. Instead, he kept his eyes focused on the ground, unmoving. His sister gasped as his parents stared in awe, a few females fainted, as a thunderous laughter burst forth. The sound of cheers and laughter were deafening, but Michael could clearly hear his own thoughts within the storm of sound. It was a simple thought.", "EDIT: Spelling", "My father was a wonderful storyteller; it wasn't exactly gravitas\u2014he possessed something much more sincere, something deep in his heart that managed to make it real. He believed it to be true, these places, and things, and people, that I do not want to necessarily say did not\u2014do not\u2014exist. After all, father's Title traces back to Norman II, Keeper of Dogwood Office Park. The market there still meets every Sunday, and I have had very good meals at the inn, when treated. Many of the caravans that pass through will stop at our abbey to be blessed before treading the interstate. Sometimes I hear them telling the same stories, and it makes it difficult to sleep at night.", "At daybreak, we assemble in the hall for morning prayers, a wash-up in the creek, and  breakfast, which humble Brother Michael, Survivor of the Pox, prepares with great care. Few dared to drink our wine or share our table before Brother Dwayne, Collector of 21 Fox Skins, came up with the clever idea to simply hide Michael from sight\u2014while I cannot truly appreciate his disfigurement, the humor is not lost on me.", "Brother Dwayne is, at heart, a bully, of this I am convinced, no less for the fact that just nigh of ", " 21st birthday, he robbed little Econolodge, He with Little More than Himself, of the 21 fox skins he had been hoarding for his Bequeathing. Econolodge's father fought with mine at the Battle of Scenic View, by mile 47, which makes the fact I was unable to help him guard it all the more humiliating. Always reassuring, however, is my time spent in the garden with Brother Unleaded, Digger of the Deepest Hole, who often sees where I cannot. His interpretation of things is most of all what drew me to the abbey in the first place. ", "\"You must not let Brother Dwayne's misgivings cloud your vision further,\" he said to me, shortly after the whole incident, while we were planting turnips. It was cool, even for midday, but we had both worked up a sweat. ", "\"Brother Dwayne is a cheat, and as one who has been cheated by the universe, I can assure you of this.\" I wiped at my brow, trying not make contact with my dirty hands. \"More to the point, isn't it rather out of character for a monk?\" ", "This made Unleaded laugh. \"You say the humor is not lost on you; nor is the irony on me. But, lest Father Caprice say otherwise, we must so long grin and bear it.\"", "I grimaced, squinted at the dirt ahead, and carved out another hole. \"Did you give any more thought to what I asked you?\"", "\"It is not up to me to decide your Title, Brother. You worry so much about the things not worth seeing!\"", "In times of less gossip, when Father Caprice, Drinker of an Entire Keg of Wine, is not in the village, Brother Unleaded is much less pointed with me. My question to him was what Mother Glenda would consider ", " accomplishment; my 21st birthday, fast approaching, would too be the day my Title was granted. Repeated were those whose feats warranted awe, mocked were those who squandered their opportunity\u2014or, in my case, were born squandered. All I asked for, and prayed for, was mediocrity. ", "When the day arrived, Brother Michael gave me bread pudding, which lifted the weight of it all for a few bites, and Brother Stuckey, Who Once Tamed a Coyote, wrote a delightful poem that he recited after prayer. Goodwill was exchanged with a toast of spirits, and we worked until the ceremony. Since Mother Glenda had fallen on the stairs to the abbey a few summers ago, a complex procession was developed whereby the entire congregation marched down to her villa, complete with chants, candles, incense; once, self-flagellation courtesy of Brother Buick, Spiller of His Own Blood More Than Any Other, in a gross miscalculation on Father Caprice's part. It was similarly humiliating to be unable to see the greatest moment of my young life so far; those watching our column on the main must have been convinced I was to be executed instead, I looked so shamed.", "\"We're here,\" Father Caprice added unnecessarily, as we were halted by the mansion at the end of the cul-de-sac where Mother Glenda lived. It was spectacularly lit, such that to my eyes it looked much like the sun were I to stare at it; fluttering banners acted the part of eclipses, I'm sure brilliantly dyed and guarded by many. Outside the gates of the Estate, villagers gathered, or at least I assume they did, and our chant hushed in to reverence when a shadow appeared in the portico. It was my time. ", "Inside, it was much darker, almost sensually lit. Incense persisted, but the scent changed, and I felt the presence of metrics. I was being judged, but not yet by Mother Glenda. An usher led me, first by hand gesture, second by hand, up a curved stairway, to a chamber with two glass-doors, not that I could make out what was beyond them even with sight. We waited for what felt like an eternity before he whispered that I may enter. ", "Mother Glenda's Title, \"Devourer of 53 Chicken Nuggets in a Single Sitting\", requires explanation: it is not that she is obese, or compelled to hoard food. It is that she was guided, not by our Verses, but some unseen force, or power, or vision, to a hidden temple\u2014like those father described\u2014where, inside, she discovered enough staple to feed the village for a week. This journey was brought on by a bout of fasting\u2014traditional in some nearby villages, before a Title is given\u2014which she broke with such vigor that it became her namesake a full week before the ceremony. The visions did not end there, however, nor did her wisdom, and the Title became much less said than 'Mother', for she was the only one we all permitted to give us such a thing as a second name. More than often a Title was obvious, it was an accomplishment, no matter how trivial\u2014", "\"But in your case, child,\" she smiled at me, I could tell, \"yours I shall give to make clear the exceptional gift you possess.\" ", "This caught me off-guard: \"Mother Glenda, surely you are humoring me.\"", "\"Hardly! Your Brother Unleaded has spoken to me before this, and again before that; he tells me of the times you spend watching the sun rise, or wandering through the wood, or toiling in the garden. Is this true?\"", "I nodded. \"Brother Unleaded is a companion in the truest sense; he makes it all very clear for me.\" ", "She did not stop beaming, \"You are so genuine, child. And fortunate. He does not pity you in the slightest; he is rather jealous, in fact.\" There were the traces of laughter from the chamber, but they were well-intentioned. \"Do you know what I believe to be your Title?\"", "This did not register with me. She took my silence for curiosity. ", "\"I think you are to be, 'He Who Sees the World for What it Truly Is'.\"", "We talked for some time, and I felt fewer sleepless nights ahead. When I was finally escorted back, the wine had been dredged from the cellar, and Father Caprice was busy reciting the Verses to bored, red-nosed travelers. Most of the brothers had gone back to the abbey for evening prayers, and the food on the table was attracting flies, not that it discouraged whom I could only assume to be beggars.", "\"Git!\" A villager smacked at the edge of the table, chasing one of them off. There was drunken laughter, crying. I searched for Brother Unleaded, only to stumble in to Brother Dwayne. He was breathing heavily. ", "\"Excuse me, Brother Dwayne\u2014\" I stopped him with an easy palm, and he swayed, \"\u2014have you seen Brother Unleaded by any chance?\"", "He cackled. \"Seen'm, that's ", ".\" Then, he dug in to his satchel and pulled out a package, wrapped in burlap. \"I got you a present.

When you turned twenty-one, you got your title, a title that would reflect your biggest accomplishment in life, whether you had already done it or you were to do it in the future. The title could become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. So many times someone was given a title like \"Suicide\" and from the depression that came along that title, suicided the next day.

I didn't care much about it, too; taking into account the name of our elder (what the heck were nuggets anyway?) I thought mine would be something unimportant as well. Maybe I hoped it was meaningless, that way I made sure I couldn't think about it too much. People tell me I overthink. I reckon the opposite.", "Finally, the village was gathered. Glenda spoke with a thick German accent, the kind of accent brewed with years of isolation and sadness. Becoming our elder was the only thing she was able to do, apart from making those nuggets of her.

The town\u2019s elder would publicly meet with each person and announce their Epithet to the town. It was a title or a phrase, supposedly based on their most defining childhood moment, accomplishment, or trait. It led to some titles that would be funny if the person wasn\u2019t stuck with it for the rest of their life. \u2018Bed Surfer,\u2019 \u2018Diver Through Windows,\u2019 and \u2018Can\u2019t Find Pants\u2019 all sprang to mind.

Ice didn\u2019t really know. She wasn\u2019t ever really interested in magic. Well, except for elemental magic, for obvious reasons, but as far as she was concerned that was something else entirely. Not just another facet of the unimaginable potential of the arcane arts, but something more rooted in the world. A way of life, that\u2019s what it was.", "With a start Ice realized the line had moved forward again. ", " She stepped forward, hoping her nerves didn\u2019t show to the crowd that had gathered. She shouldn\u2019t be nervous. It\u2019s not like she\u2019ll even be around here much longer. But she hadn\u2019t expecting to take part in this ceremony, and it threw her off guard. She had left the town and joined a mercenary company, Sharp Edge, when she was 16. She wanted to see the world, make a name for herself and, most of all, get out of that tiny corner of the world. She left her mother, her home, and her friends behind.", "By the time she was 19, though, she wanted to move on again. She traveled on her own for a while, and ended up near home. She had been back for about two months, and was planning on setting off again soon. But. She was here for her 21st birthday, and that meant she was taking part in the ceremony.", "Ice looked out at the crowd. Everyone was talking, laughing and joking about what name Glenda would give to the young woman she was quietly speaking with now. A few of them seemed to be eyeing her. Not really surprising. Even if it weren\u2019t for the reputation of a reckless troublemaker she had made while growing up, a fire genasi tends to stand out. Even here in Eberron, genasi are extremely rare.", "They were probably talking about which fire she had started her Epithet would come from. That\u2019s what everyone would expect - something about fire. Not that Ice minded - it\u2019s just that sometimes she got tired of people looking at her and never seeing anything more than just fire. Maybe that was why she kept the name Ice when they had given it to her. Her mother named her Adria when she was born, but following genasi tradition she chose a name after her element when she was 8. Aestus Concalesco, drawing from the Old Tongue. The townsfolk had shortened it to Ice and spent a good week laughing at their joke, but Ice decided to keep it.", "Ice took a deep breath to steady herself. She ran her hand along the sheath of her sword. It was a Flame Tongue, a blade enchanted to be able to burst into flames. It had been a gift from her section when she left Sharp Edge, and it had gotten her out of more than a few tight situations. She thought about pulling it out and running her fingers along the intricate flame patterns embossed into the metal, but thought better of it. That would look pretty strange here in front of everyone. ", "Now. It was time. Glenda beckoned her onto the small podium on the side of the square. The crowd brightened - they had been waiting for this. Ice stepped up and walked over to Glenda. She curtsied and gave the traditional greeting. \u201cPeace favor you, Glenda Sabel, Devourer of 53 Portions of Chicken in One Sitting.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you, Aestus Concalesco, Who is Without Epithet.\u201d Glenda took a moment to look at Ice. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d", "\u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d Ice nodded. Glenda placed her hands on Ice\u2019s temples and closed her eyes. Ice gasped - she saw all of her strongest memories in rapid succession. The time she accidentally burned down the abandoned barn on the edge of town; the time she got into a fight with a much older boy and broke her arm; the time she had borrowed a horse from the inn and charged down the streets, calling herself a knight. Everything she had ever done was replayed right there, in perfect clarity. It seemed to go on forever, but at last it faded.", "Ice shuddered as she came back to the present. She couldn\u2019t have said if it had lasted a moment or an eternity. She felt as though she might fall to her knees, but Glenda\u2019s surprisingly firm grip helped support her.", "Glenda turned to the crowd, which was waiting expectantly, the last laughs from some proposed Epithet dying as everyone held their breath.", "\u201cAestus Concalesco, On the Balance of Life and Death.\u201d", "The square was filled with silence, and everyone felt it. The crowd, suddenly sobered, could only watch Ice and Glenda. No one moved, no one made a sound. Ice turned from Glenda to the townsfolk. She met her mother\u2019s eyes and cleared her throat.", "\u201cMy kind, the genasi\u2026 we don\u2019t live that long. Yeah, our lifespans can be pretty impressive, but, well\u2026 we live hard. We live fast. I never really expected to live past 20, and some of us don\u2019t get half that. It\u2019s our way, the elemental energy coursing through our veins. You can never choose who lives or dies, so we just go and fight like we\u2019re running out of time. We are always running out of time. To be honest, I\u2019ve imagined death so much it feels more like a memory. All I can do is live to the fullest with the time I have.\u201d", "The silence was even heavier than before, the townsfolk caught in its embrace.

The nice-guy persona didn't faze him a bit nowadays.", "He had initially made the connection by accident. A photograph of the crime scene was featured in the daily paper, and Mark had the feeling he'd seen it before. And just like that, a side-by-side comparison made it obvious. Bob had painted the scene of the crime, down to the individual trees.", "And he'd painted it on television. On television, in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers.", "He turned his attention back to the screen. Bob was working on the foreground, carefully applying a shade of dark green. Any beauty the image might have once held was gone. Instead, a single question remained.", "Who was buried there?", "Mark didn't realize it until the episode was almost done. Bob was meticulously placing the branches on a single tree in the background, a strange tree that was split down the middle.", "With a start, Mark got to his feet and ran to the window, looking out at his backyard.", "And in his backyard was a single tree, split down the middle.", "Bob's voice spoke from the television in the living room:", "Bob ran the brush through a thick glob of oil paint and wiped the excess on his pants. \nIt was nighttime, eerily quiet. \nBob gently tapped the brush against the canvas, filling in a line of pine trees with a dusting of snow. \nOutside, the wind howled and beat against the sides of the cabin. Snow had piled so high in only a matter of hours, Bob had to clear the chimney of ice for the fire thrice. The fire that, at the moment, was the only thing keeping him alive. Well that... and the unfinished business. Business that must be finished. \nBut first, the painting. \nBob smiled to himself and stood back, admiring the intricacy of the painted landscape. Reminiscent of Aspen, the forest scene pulled at his emotions. Well it should! This was to be a successful night! ", "He began to float off into day dreams, knowing that time was on his side. He didn't need to rush. As he sometimes did, Bob began to imagine the faces of those he'd \"explored\". \nA young girl from FL. Brown hair. Green eyes. Her screams reminded him of birds cawing. \nA teenage boy from CA. Football player. Bit back, but eventually gave up. \nA mother from WA. Blonde with a soccer mom complex. Tennis shoes. Perfume. \nHe let the feeling of euphoria consume him for a moment, ignoring any doubts. ", "Sirens broke this happy daze, loud and coming towards the cabin. Bob dashed to the window, and sure enough the blues and reds of two law enforcement vehicles echoed against the trees. He froze, calculating in his head. It had to be now. \nBob scrambled around the room, gathering several things in a pack. He threw on a thick parka, boots, and gloves. Tossing the pack over his back, he returned to the painting. \nBob slipped a marker from his pocket, bending down to the right hand corner of the canvas. He signed. ", "\"Ross. Thanks Again.\" ", "He glanced to the cellar door, feeling an odd sense of longing. It was only a moment. He had made a choice now. This last one would be a sacrifice. She would live. \nGiving the cabin one last look, Bob slipped out the back door and into the snow. The lights were brighter now, and heavy footstep could be heard not far off.

Wouldn't the mics pick up on that? Like every angry bee in the world was watching from beyond those lights...", "Bob turned to the easel, letting the weight of his palette reassure him, to focus him, to center him. As always, his concern was for the detail. The painting had to be perfect, otherwise there was no point, no point to this at all.", "Beginning the process, his body reacted: his heart thudding in his chest, his vision dampening into what he imagines others might call \"tunnel vision\" \u2014 though he wouldn't know, as he wasn't what you'd call a \"people person\". Careful now, not to let the gargantuan thudding in his breast move the brush astray.", "Trees came to his mind and fled out of his brush, resolving into a sordid display on the canvas.

If people did not need to fly planes, where else were people not necessary? The thought seemed to empty the studio. Was he alone?", "Faster now.

Anything more and his work, his very important work, might be ruined.", "Before he knew it, time had passed and his painting was completed: a macabre display of trees, mountains and lakes, grisly except for the details, wretched in the knowledge that produced it.", "The lights dimmed.

And perhaps one more killer would be behind bars this evening. A killer that wasn't Bob Ross. Because Bob Ross isn't a killer. The thought that someone might think that of him appalled him.", "Rick looked down at the crumpled picture one more time, which was now shaking in his hand.", "It couldn't be. The image was unmistakable now, he knew he had to return to that place, but he was afraid of what he would find. Bob Ross used to say that each painting was his own little world, a creation spawned from the mind, but that was a lie. The yellow forest meadow Ross had painted did not exist solely in the painter's head- it had already existed in Rick's life long before the brush had touched the canvas.", " he thought, feeling his heart begin to race.", "He had found the old episode of Bob painting the picture of his backyard, and watched it in excruciating detail, over and over again. Listened to everything that Bob had said, the way he painted the picture, hung on every articulate attention to the scene, as if in a trance. Watching the stranger bring the meadow of his childhood to life with minute detail was surreal. ", "\u201cIn your world, you can do anything your heart desires,\u201d Bob Ross said, as he pressed the brush to the canvas. Bob started the painting with two large elm trees, standing stoically in the meadow. It appeared as if Bob had conjured the pair from his imagination, but Rick would have recognized those two trees anywhere in the world.", "Bob continued to talk as he painted. \u201cI used to walk around and look at a lot of nature. If painting teaches you nothing else, it will teach you to look at nature with different eyes. It will teach you to see things that have been there all your life, and you've never noticed. Enjoy nature...it's worthwhile.\u201d", "In the context of the episode, Bob's comments seemed innocuous and cheery. Now, they made Rick's blood run cold.", "\u201cLet's really make it come alive.\u201d Bob began to draw foliage, lining the trees with thick yellow bushes. \u201cIf you've ever walked through the woods early in the morning, all the creatures are out playing in here. This is where they live, in all these bushes.\u201d", "Rick stopped to stare at the giant elm behind his house, the one the Bob had lined with bushes in the episode. It looked exactly like Ross' painting, except for the ground. The ground beneath the trees were brown and barren. The bushes beneath them must have died out.", "He turned back to the video.", "\u201cMaybe it rained last night.\u201d Bob Ross began to dash blue into the front of the painting. \u201cAfter it rains you always have some nice rain puddles.

He had stayed up all night with his mother, watching the blurred flash of patrol lights through rain spattered windows. The cops had found nothing. For weeks they had searched, until the memory of Rick's father had slowly faded from the spotlight of local news channels and came to rest in the back of Rick's consciousness, never to leave.", "He returned back to the present, where he stood behind his old house. The shovel was trembling in Rick's hand now, as he stood beneath the giant elm. He knew what he had to do, but he no longer had the strength to do it. He looked up the clouds, which were large, overcast, and gray. ", " he thought.", "Just then, he felt his phone buzz. He looked down. It was his mother. He picked up the phone, holding the receiver to his ear.", "\u201cRick!\u201d his mother said. \u201cThey found you father. It was Ross, just like the rest. He was buried in one of the places he painted.\u201d Rick could hear his mother choking back tears.", "\u201cI know mom,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI'm there now. The meadow behind our old house.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, her voice sounding confused. \u201cNo, they found him in the mountains.\u201d", "Rick put his the phone down for a minute. The sky was opening up, the clouds shrinking smaller, and turning whiter. ", "Just then, Rick heard a voice behind him.", "\u201cHey there friend. Nice day for a walk.\u201d", "Rick spun around. A figure was standing before him. ", "The person was shrouded in the shadow of the elm tree. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he called out uncertainly.", "\u201cJust a friendly face,\u201d the figure said. The man stepped forward out of the shade, revealing a large, fuzzy brown afro and a kind, tanned face. He was holding a pistol in his right hand, which was pointed at Rick.

Would you like to be part of it?\u201d", "Rick's throat ran dry. It was starting to drizzle now, but he was too numb to feel the raindrops.

Do you have accomplices working for you?\u201d I ask, my voice quivering.", "He shakes his head. \u201cYou still don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d he sighs. With one smooth movement, he whips out a dagger and stabs his painting.

Soon, it would be disturbed and the water would riffle. \nHe would add that into his painting, he decided. The riffle was an important part.

It was time to sign off, and start having some real fun. ", "\"I'm so happy with how this one turned out, and I hope you're happy with yours too. You know,\" He chuckled, eyeing the painting with fondness, \"I think I might just keep this one for my personal collection...I'm Bob Ross, saying goodbye for now, and I'll see you next time with a brand new scene.\" ", "\"...and another tree right... there... nice big, happy, tree. Yeah.\" I followed the prompting as usual, but I still couldn't get over what was with this guy and all the friggin' trees. As class concluded, I began rinsing out my brushes and packing them up. I hung after to talk to our painting teacher. \"Its been nice learning from you in person, Bob.\" He smiled. \"Yeah, you've been an excellent student.\" I gave him a look of surprise. \"Really? I won't lie, I'm not big on my paintings, they don't look as real as yours.\" Bob just smiled cryptically. \"Sometimes its not the picture thats painted, but the technique of the stroke.\" He took me aside, and showed me a picture with a lot of empty space, a crane with its back to a small tree looking toward the empty space. \"What do you see?\" I looked at it awhile. \"The leaves and the crane are all pointed the same way... there's... harmony.\" He smiled very wide, patting me on the shoulder. \"That's right. What else?\" I looked at him, then the painting. \"Well... there's a lot of empty space. Its almost like he didn't finish it, but on the other hand, the crane is looking toward the empty space.\" \"That's right,\" Bob said, \"the crane is one with nature, and is able to face the unknown.\" I scratched my head. \"That's deep, but what does that have to do with my... style?\" Bob grinned. This painting is from Musashi Miyamoto. He was a samurai, one of very few who honorably died of old age... his sword technique was superb, and wouldn't you know it, he also was pretty handy with a paint-brush.\" I marveled a moment. I've heard of Musashi. I'd read his Book of Five Rings. \"Yeah, he said he used his mastery of swordsmanship to also master other arts.\" Bob turned to me, grasping my shoulders. \"That's absolutely right. One can master something, and then master himself. When one masters themselves, they can face anything.\" He releases my shoulders. \"I think its time. What would you think of taking a... 'master' class?\" I rubbed my head. \"Yeah, of course. When are you thinking?\" Bob's smiled drifted away, his eyes becoming cold and serious. \"Right now.\" A feeling that fate had brought me to this moment snuck up on me. That surreal moment when something you've always wanted but now you fear about your ability to rise to the occassion is right in front of you, happening for real. I licked my lips. \"Sure.\" He nodded solemnly. \"Then lets get started.\" He locked up the classroom, then the office, and we walked down the street a few blocks. We stopped at a storage unit. He entered the passcode to go inside, and then keyed open the unit, lifting the door. Numerous paintings were strewn all about, stacked and, frankly, not well cared for. He flicked a lantern on. We stepped inside, and he lowered the door behind us, sealing us in. The back wall, I learned, was false. It was canvas curtain that he swept aside, and taking my wrist in his hand, led me behind the curtain. He found another set of lights, and turned them on. It lit up the small area, and in the center, was a metal table with leather straps. The straps were buckled tight around the body of a man. I recognized him. He was one of the anatomy models from a college-drawing class I'd taken. Back when I was drawing. As the lights came on, the body stirred. His brown hair was all messed up, and his pale blue eyes flicked incessantly, trying to adjust to the sudden light after hours of pitch darkness. He was gagged, and started murmuring in \"mmphs.\" I couldn't believe it. Bob stood by my side. \"When things decompose, it becomes fuel for new life. An animal dies, and soon a spread of beautiful flowers will spring up in its place.\" He went to a table nearby, an assortment of sharp and pointed objects glistening in the artificial light. He picked up an exacto-knife. He came toward me, fitting a fresh blade in the pen-like holder. \"I've achieved an art-form that is one with nature, the same way that old samurai used the art of life-taking to learn to paint.\" I was in horror, but also in awe. No one would believe that Bob was killing people to perfect his painting. \"Each person that... 'contributes' to my art, I honor them. I bury them and plant a tree. You'd truly be surprised how much their decomposition feeds the tree... makes it...\" he half-way chuckled the last word, \"...happy.\" He places his hands on my shoulders, having circled behind me. I'm dangerously aware of the exactoknife still in his hand, its blade pointed directly at my neck. I can't help but wonder if I'll be another one of those trees. He guides me forward to the table. \"You told me once that you'd give anything to paint the way I do. But let me ask, how much are you willing to TAKE?\" His voice became gravelly and frightening. I gulped air. \"Take?\" \"Yes. This man's life is worth way more to your art than a lifetime of posing, but do you have it inside you to take it?\" I'm shaking. I close my eyes. \"DO YOU?!\" He shakes my shoulders. I open my eyes, and look at him. He has let go of my shoulders and is now standing beside me. I look at him, and then look at the man on the table. I'm suddenly filled with disgust. Bob reads my eyes. He turns the exacto-knife over in his hand, holding it out to me handle-first. He whispers, barely audible over the hum of the lights and the moans of the man on the table. \"Do you have what it takes?\"", "\"I do.\" I take the exacto-knife from his hands.\n\"Then I'll guide you, as usual, in what strokes to make and how.\" He laughs.", "\"Now, lets make some happy trees.\"", "It was the trees that got my attention. The timing of everything was more than a coincidence. It had to be. She went missing in early fall, just when the trees are changing color in northern Minnesota. We had seen an increase in missing persons lately but we hadn\u2019t connected the dots yet.", "You can\u2019t blame me for having my vices. Sure I\u2019m a man of the law but after a long day or on a big case lighting up a joint just helps me zone out. When Tera first wet missing something just felt familiar. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it but I felt like I had heard the story before. I sat on my couch thinking about her. Was she still alive? Maybe she just got lost. It\u2019s easy to get lost in the woods after all. ", "I lit up a joint to take my mind off the day and turned on the TV. Nothing good on as I kept changing the channels. The weed was kicking in. I need a drink. When I came back I looked at the TV. His hair is what caught my attention. Puffy, curly, light brown afro. Somehow it worked for him. I chuckled and sat back down on the couch. His voice was calming and almost entrancing. The sound of the brushes on the canvas was relaxing. It was magical how he was taking a line and making it into something. It didn\u2019t feel forced at all. He just painted like he had always been there and wanted to show you how beautiful it was.", "I don\u2019t know how long I sat there, how many paintings he did. Every one of them I felt like I had been there. Like I had stood on that shore or in that forest. It was on the fourth painting that I started to realize the reason they were familiar. I had been there. The trees. They had been that shade not too long ago, a few weeks at most. Right around the time Tera went missing.", "I thought back to the previous paintings I had seen him do. A small pond in the summer on the edge of a forest. The edge of a lake in early winter. It couldn\u2019t be.\nI got up and rushed to my car. It was getting chilly now. The cold breeze snapped me out of my high a little bit. I had to get to the station. As I rushed in the only person there was Gina on dispatch. I barely said hi to the poor girl as a hurried find the case files. Theft. Domestic. Drugs. Missing Persons. There it was. I put it on the desk and started piling up the files. Where was it? There. Mary Johnson. Missing June 18th. Last seen near Dooley\u2019s Bar and Grill. About half a mile from Fischer\u2019s Pond. I knew these places looked familiar! Another one. Tina Francine. Missing November 8th. Last seen leaving work at the Quick Stop. Barely a mile from Whistler Lake.", "I could hardly believe what I had found. How did everyone miss it? Months, years he\u2019s been doing this and telling everyone exactly what he did. Yet no one saw it. Not until now. Now to convince everyone\u2026", "The sun was blazing high above Grand Teton National Park and the forest ranger wiped his forehead before taking a drink from his water bottle. He sighed deeply frustrated by the chaos he and his department was being put through. \n\u201cCaptain, have you found anything in your sector?\u201d the radio buzzed.\n\u201cNothing interesting in my area\u201d Captain Dereks responded back into the mic. In the distance, he could see the helicopter surveying the other side of the lake trying to figure out where the next body could be. The past couple days had been absolute hell for him and everyone in the forestry department. Search and rescues were nothing new to him or his team but this one was different because they had the FBI on the asses while being kept completely in the dark.", "\nIn the past few months it was discovered that the oil paintings done by famed TV Bob Ross were real locations but bodies were being found too. Three bodies later and no one could ever say this was just a coincidence but it was rumored that every single body found was charred and had looked like a Hiroshima bombing victim. A serial killer arsonist with a flair for the arts sounded too bizarre to be true but the government mandated lock down was no joke. Thankfully the arsonist kept his flames under control without setting the forest ablaze but burning bodies in the open wilderness didn\u2019t make any sense at all to him.\nDereks stopped once again to stare at the tall trees around him trying to make sense of the whole operation. Maddox Silvens was their designated babysitter from the FBI taking over his park and that was the only clear thing he got from Silvens because any other information about the operation was too high above his paygrade. It was unsettling to him that he couldn\u2019t get any more information about why his park was next but at least the media wasn\u2019t here to bother him or his department. He knew it was only a matter of time before the chaos of the media would arrive when words gets out that federal agents are focusing on his park. Every single park in the country was closed and from talking with other park rangers his seemed to be the one getting most of the unwanted government attention.", "\n\u201cAmanda, any update on what we\u2019re looking for?\u201d he spoke into his walkie talkie. \n\u201cWere just about done going through all of Bob Ross\u2019 paintings and we have narrowed it down to about 30 paintings from the show that could look like our park,\u201d replied Amanda. \u201cShould we start looking at other works outside of the show?\u201d \nDereks thought for a moment \u201cNo Amanda, were already searching this blindly for a possible needle in a haystack. I\u2019m going to start heading back soon and we can over what you and Jason have narrowed it down to.\u201d Just then the park ranger spotted something just beyond the trees moving. He raced over cautiously hoping not to run into something dangerous. In the clearing there was a barely clothed man groaning and trying in vain to get himself up.\n\u201cSIR ARE OKAY?!\u201d he yelled out running towards the helpless man. \u201cMy name is Park Ranger Dereks and I am here to help. How long have you been lost in the forest?\u201d Derreks examined the man but he didn\u2019t appear to be hurt, just week from exhaustion. There were no active orders for a missing person but judging by his raggedy condition it looked like he had been out here for a while. He moved the long hair out of the mans face but he couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say. \u201cSir save your energy, help is on the way.\u201d Reaching into his bag he grabbed a flare gun and shot it into the air. \u201cAmanda, Ive found an exhausted hiker and I need a medical airlift.\u201d \n\u201cRoger that Sir. Medic has spotted your flare and help is on the way\u201d responded Amanda\n\u201cRun\u201d the lost hiker weezed in his feeble state. \n\u201cI cant do that sir, help will be here any moment\u201d the deep look of concern on the man\u2019s face puzzled Dereks. He also couldn\u2019t help but think the face looked familiar, was he a local, a frequent guest\u2026.\nDereks stared a little more \u201cYOU\u2019RE BOB R---\u201c but before he could finish the man he was holding became extremely hot and burned his hands.\n\u201cRun!\u201d the mysterious man said one last time but it was too late. The incoming helicopter saw the bright flash of light from above and stayed hovering in place. Silvens and his partner were up the hill and not far behind and saw it happen.\n\u201cFUCK! I thought we had more time!\u201d Silvens threw his radio against the tree out of frustration while his partner got closer and looked down at the two newly charred bodies.", "\n\u201cSir, we should have had two more days! I don\u2019t know where we went wrong\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care just fix it! We can\u2019t afford to lose another so tell the nerds back at HQ to get their shit straight or I will personally shove my foot up their collective asses! Now lets move onto the next one before this tracts any unwarranted attention.\u201d The helicopter had landed safely nearby and Silven had picked up his smashed radio before heading back into the chopper with his partner.", "\nBack at camp Amanda looked at the entrance to the park and saw a group of vans approaching the gate. \u201cIm sorry guys but were closed right now\u201d Amanda had yelled at the group of white vans. They didn\u2019t listen and the vans parked in their position. A man in a suit emerged from the leading vehicle and approached her. \n\u201cMa\u2019am Im Agent Stottles with the Department of Homeland Security. I need to speak with you Director so we can begin our work here\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir but My director is busy tending to a lost hiker he found but I can direct you to the FBI agent that has taken over before you got here.\u201d\n\u201cFBI?\u201d Stottles looked confused to Amanda and she saw the other vans turn around and peel off. The driver of his van poked his head out and yelled \u201cSir! We need to go, the target is on the move\u201d", "\nWithout so much as saying another word he ran back to the van and they drove off.

You follow me so far, mate?\"", "\"Uh...yea sure...\"", "\"Ok, so, Th' Association is led by a group of of aliens known only as th' masters. Th' masters sent us here as a distraction.

This news is hitting me all at once and as it takes a while to process, I turn to Wallace and say:", "\"With my life, old friend.\" I bring my right hand over and pet him a little. He moves closer to me as he rubs up against my neck. At that moment there is a knock at my door. Wallace turns to me, his face petrified with terror. ", "\"Oh god...they're here,\" he whispers. ", "\"That's it.\" Muffet came up, claws out, and patted me on the cheek, just lightly enough to bring me back out of the swirling stupor. \"You have a drinking problem.\" I sat up, groaning, assuming that I was in an alcohol-induced dream, and knocked Muffet off the back of the couch down to the cushion next to me.", "\"Fuck off, Muffet,\" I slurred. Muffet stiffened for a moment, and then regained that perpetually haughty look she had on her face. So quickly I couldn't track it, she swiped claws across my arm, leaving a stinging sensation and little droplets of blood welling up in her wake. That immediately sobered me up. \"WHAT THE HELL,\" I said, putting my hand over the wound. Man that stung.", "\"This shit is the last fucking straw. You come home later and later every night, ever since you realized this job is turning you into somebody you don't want to be. You're drinking more and more. For the last month you've been blackout drunk by eight every night. About half the time I don't get fed. And now this shit.\" Muffet gestured into the kitchen where a bottle stood up from her water dish. \"You filled my bowl with vodka. This is unacceptable. You're being an irresponsible ass and you need treatment.\" Muffet cleaned her claws she had used to swipe at me and it finally sunk it just how weird it was that my cat was talking to me.", "\"Um,\" I whispered, realizing how dry my mouth was, before throwing up the contents of my stomach onto the couch. Muffet hissed and jumped back.", "\"Disgusting. You're a mess. Calling in sick to work just to drink\" Her hackles were raised and she looked very unfriendly. I wiped my mouth and looked at her, really looked at her. \"First things first. Fresh water in my bowl and some of that leftover chicken you have in the fridge. Chop chop.\" Her mouth was moving. Unable to do anything else, I got up, poured out the vodka in her bowl, rinsed it, and poured fresh water in it. There was no light from the kitchen window, how late was it? Muffet leaped up beside me and drank from the sink while I got the leftover chicken fingers from the bar I had eaten earlier in the week. She munched on them happily in between her lecturing sentences.", "\"Look,\" she said in a muffled voice, her mouth full of chicken, \"you're a fucking mess and I love you, so I've taken it upon myself to help you out, breaking the rules. I'm not supposed to talk to you.\" I nodded, the room spinning. \"Trash can, under the sink.\" She called, just in time for another wave of sickness to take me down. \"Drink a glass of water. You're in a perpetual state of dehydration at this point.\" Mechanically, I obeyed the cat, fighting against the nausea. She burped as she finished the chicken and cleaned her face, knocking the box the leftovers were in to the trashcan I had left out. \"But I'm going to help you if you want to be helped. For the next couple weeks, if you don't come home immediately after work and start looking for a job that doesn't make you want to drink yourself to death and leave me alone and sad, I'm going to call the police. Every. Time.\" She sat up on her hind legs and waggled her paws at me. \"I think I can still operate a touchscreen so don't try me.\" I nodded. \"We'll discuss this more tomorrow since you're too drunk now, and remember I love you. I just can't be in a house with an alcoholic anymore.\" I nodded, suddenly overcome with emotion, and grabbed Muffet. She bristled but tolerated it tensely as I began to sob into the fur at the scruff of her neck, knowing that she was right, knowing that she had broken the rules because she cared about me.", "\"Shhhhh. It's okay, little kitten. We're gonna get through this, together. I love you still.\"", "Everything was a haze as I made my way to the kitchen. The party had been absolutely bonkers, but a responsible man always remembers to feed his pets. I struggled over to the fridge, grabbed a nice, chilled bottle of milk and poured it as carefully as I could into my cat's dancing water bowl.", "\"No, you idiot. That's vodka again, not milk.\" Mr.Mittens stated matter-of-factly, his blue eyes staring at me through the darkness, \"The milk is in the other bottle.\"", "I turned the bottle about and squinted hard at the label before breaking into a grin.", "\"Right again, Mr.Mittens.\"", "I replaced the glass bottle in my hand with the one in the fridge, and poured out the vodka from Mr.Mitten's water bowl. As I poured in the milk, I pet my tabby cat on the head.", "\"I wish you'd talk to me when I wasn't drunk.\"", "Mr.Mittens just purred.", "Night had settled like most of the residents of the humble household. The girl was curled up in her usual semi-fetal position on the bed and the cat had assumed a seemingly loving position that curled around the girl as she slept. ", " he thought bitterly while looking at the cat, ", "He had felt the dormant anger coursing through his veins since the girl returned home. It was the same dance: she came home, fed him and the cat, and made herself food while she eagerly drank her Mom water. He watched as her mannerisms became looser the more she drank the liquid in her cup, the liquid that smelled simultaneously sharp and light. It had made him curious before, and it made him curious now. He knew the cat\u2019s intent when she knocked the liquid filled glass to the floor, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.", "The girl had worried and watched over him cautiously after she realized he had drank it. That was nice. But it waned when he didn\u2019t get sick and she went to bed. And then the anger came. Even when he felt it unbottle he didn\u2019t want to stop it. The consequences be damned, as long as it was out.", "\u201cDo you even love me?\u201d", "The words burst out of him like a geyser. He couldn\u2019t even feel guilty about it; he knew that this was a natural consequence of what he had been feeling. The control was gone, but that was beyond him and he was OK with that.", "It seemed like the words were pouring out of him like a broken saltshaker. It was beyond freeing. He hoped she felt the words as deeply as he had felt her actions. He couldn\u2019t stand for this anymore, not this kind of love.", "\u201cWhat about when she attacks me? You\u2019ve watched it. I\u2019ve seen you laugh. You pat my head and give me a treat like it\u2019s not big deal. But that doesn\u2019t make it better and that doesn\u2019t make me less afraid.\u201d", "As he said this his eyes flashed to the cat\u2019s. She held his gaze threateningly steady.", "\u201cI need security. I don\u2019t get that from you. I\u2019m not happy. Are you even happy?\u201d", "The girl jerked and sat up suddenly in her sleep. She looked around wildly, her chest softly heaving, as her sleepbroken eyes tried to focus on a figure, any figure that would make sense, in her room. After a few moments of fear, she sunk uneasily back into her pillow.", "He jumped up onto the bed and curled up into the bent crook of her legs. She sleepily stroked his back before falling back into the warm depths of sleep. He sighed heavily and felt the draw of easy contentment that this life offered him.", "\u201cI love you Mom, but we could do so much better than this.\u201d", "He felt the weight of the Mom water press on him and he passed into a sleep as deep as the girl. They both awoke around the same time in the morning, dehydrated and irritable. As the girl moved into her normal routine, he felt that they shared the same vague sense of emptiness that neither knew how to fix. Was there a fix? ", "Maybe this was life, he thought. Maybe I just watch her begin her day and wait for her to end it. Maybe this is love. Maybe this is what I\u2019m meant to do. Maybe I want some more Mom water to get me through the day.", "While he watched the girl get ready, the cat attacked him and he screamed. The girl tended to him after, petting his head, saying sweet words, and giving him tasty things. This would carry him through the day.", "But even then, he couldn\u2019t forget his anger. It had leaked out of him and he couldn\u2019t stuff it back it in. All he knew is that the Mom water might make it a little more bearable.", "I groggily opened my eyes, a pounding headache already making itself known in my temples. Somehow I'd ended up on my couch -- sort of. One of my legs hung over the side, my foot brushing against the cold glass of an empty vodka bottle. It had been one of ", " nights.", "I stuck a finger in my ear, convinced I'd left my phone auto-playing youtube videos for the whole night. I wasn't in the mood to hear some fake-happy personality talk about clickbait bullshit.", "I managed to drag myself up to a sitting position, more or less. Whatever it was, it sounded distant. Small. Only now did I notice the empty six-pack spread across my couch. Great. The smell was going to take weeks to come out.", "\"What the fuck was I watching?\" I asked no-one in particular as I forced myself to stand, uneasily swaying as my body fought against every action with a wave of nausea and a hammer-blow to my head. I scrambled for my phone, tossing away couch cushions until I found it in the crack between two thick pillows I'd taken from my bed. The battery was completely drained.", "The voice was a little louder, but still on the edge of my hearing. Someone else had to be in the house. I wasn't sure whether to be terrified or thrilled. Roy had been trying to set me up with this girl from his work, but we'd never really gotten past the 'casual conversation' stage.", "At least, I hoped so.", "No, the voice was definitely not coming from a woman. Or a man, for that matter. In fact, it seemed to be coming from the side table. Confused and exceptionally hung over, I stepped toward the small, unassuming fish bowl that my sister had bought me as a shitty birthday gift several months prior. ", "I almost fell backwards as the tiny voice squeaked from the equally tiny gold fish that was staring up at me, its tail flicking back and forth in the water. A small bottle of vodka, like you'd get on an airline for twelve bucks, bumped against the glass lip and bobbed gently.", "The gold fish watched me for another second, then turned and audibly gasped. ", "I swore to never drink again. I'd been piss-drunk a few times before, but hallucinations? That was something entirely new.", "The gold fish -- I should really name him one of these days -- completed its loop of the little plastic castle and returned to its former spot, bumping into the glass. ", "Somewhere in the back of my mind, it made perfect sense for this fish to be talking. Talking to ", ". The gears slowly turned over as I pointed at the bottle.", "\"Uhh...I think I put that in there last night. Sorry.\"", "It looked at me like a cow would look at an oncoming train, then promptly turned around.", "I swayed in place. \"Wait...am I drunk, or are you?\"", "Temporarily satisfied once more, it stared at me in thought before answering.", " It blinked. ", "\"Right, well...I'm just gonna go to bed now. I'll change your water later, I guess...\"", "I stumbled into the bedroom, collapsed on the mattress, and passed out to the tiny voice rediscovering its only source of entertainment.", "Over and over.", "I absent mindedly chewed on a carrot stick, occasionally taking a swig from a bottle of cheap vodka from the corner shop. Classic Friday night. What I hadn't realised is that I was pouring from my vodka bottle instead of my water bottle while getting Lee something to drink. ", "'Oi!' I heard a voice from behind, making no effort to mask its contempt.", "'Wha...?' I 'said'.", "'Oi, dickhead! Feed me!' The rude demand originated from my two year old grey holland lop rabbit, who was standing on his hind legs and pointing at me accusingly. He'd never spoke to me before. I wasn't aware rabbits could do that.", "'Are you... talking?' I mumbled.", "'Yes, tosspot. I'm talking. TO YOU. GET ME FOOD.' The little terror had put four feet on the ground, and he had arched his back. His ears were flat against his body, ready to charge.", "'Oh for fuck's sake. You do this all the time. I wanted to get a rabbit because you lot are all so cute n fluffy...' I groaned, 'but you act royal as fuck, dude. \"Oh pet me now\" \"I deserve to be stroked.\" Why are you like this? I buy you food, I give you a nice pen that you can run around and rub your chin on everything, I even throw you some banana every now and then, but you just give me this attitude.'", "'Yeah but you're a bit of a dickhead. Didn't occur to you to get TWO rabbits, did you? Maybe I get a bit lonely when you fuck off to school and do whatever. \"Ooh I'm so smart because I'm human\" all I want is some company, a few bitches here and there, and maybe I did want you to pet me that one time after surgery,' he shuddered at the memory, 'but nooooo, YOU had to be the alpha rabbit. Prick,' he ranted.", "I couldn't believe this - what an ungrateful bellend! That little shit knew I couldn't afford a second rabbit, he obviously understands english and has been in the room when I have said that, many times. I grabbed a banana from the kitchen, and lobbed it at him. He caught the fruit in his mouth, biting it in two, throwing one half at my face. It hit me square in the nose, at considerable speed. He jumped in the air twice, binkying, and ran into his cardboard hut, flopping contentedly, nibbling on some of the banana.", "'Dickhead,' I muttered, leaving the room.", "\"AHH Jesus H. Christ, what kind of masterpiece be this?!\"", "Zack bolted up from the couch expecting an intruder. It was Friday night and he was home drinking and enjoying some much needed relaxation. In his tipsy state Zack grabbed his nearest weapon, a fork, and slowly crept towards the source of the mysterious voice. ", "He crept up to his kitchen and tentatively peered around the corner. He saw nothing out of place until a shimmer caught his eye. On closer inspection he saw his bottle of Vodka had tipped some how.

I think you are alright.\" The voice came again, this time from Bruno.", "\"Bruno. You can talk.\" Mohit said finally realising who was speaking.", "\"Holy cow!

He saw that Bruno's bowl was empty and realised that Bruno had indeed accidentally drank the vodka.", "\"There are three rules of being a pet. I broke first two of them.\" Bruno said not meeting Mohit's eyes. It was the same look Bruno gave when he would break something of Mohit.", "\"What rules?\" Mohit asked.

Never saw that movie, or any movie for that matter.\" Bruno said.", "\"What? Why? How? You are always beside me when we watch movies.\" Mohit said.", "\"On that screen.

That thing is always on when you are in the house.\" Bruno said matter-of-factly.", "\"Huh! Ok.\" Mohit said. \"What is the third rule of fight club... err... being a pet?\"", "\"It depends on the animal. For dogs, it is that you will never leave your owner, come what may.\"", "\"What if the owner is abusive?\" Mohit asked.", "\"Come what may.\" Bruno said with a fierce loyalty in his eyes.

They are killing me.\" Bruno complained.", "\"Sorry dude. I will take you to the vet tomorrow. Besides, we have to get your b--, some other stuff done as well.\" Mohit said barely able to change his sentence midway.", "Bruno's expression changed immediately hearing about the vet.", "\"Nah man! I am cool. A few fleas are actually good for me.\" Bruno said quickly.", "\"Sorry Bruno. But we have to do that.\" Mohit said leaving all pretence.", "\"You get it done first, you horny dog. Don't think I don't know what you do with that small screen.\" Bruno said taking the offensive. ", "This time, Mohit's face turned white. He never considered that Bruno was watching. He was even more confused by Bruno using the word dog for him. How was it offensive, coming from Bruno? ", "\"It's different Bruno. I can take care if something accidentally happens. But if you did something like that, who will take care of the pups.\" Mohit said pleadingly.", "\"You are taking my care. You can take care of the pups.\" Bruno said still aggressive.", "\"I can't afford it Bruno. Please understand.\" ", "Bruno looked at Mohit sombrely and nodded.", "\"I don't want it one bit but I understand.\" Bruno said moving his front paw and putting it on Mohit's hand. \"Can we at least wait for some more time. A few months, couple of years, maybe?\" Bruno said hopefully.", "\"Sorry Bruno. There is a bitch coming in the compound these days. I don't want something to happen between you two that leads to Bruno juniors. It has to happen tomorrow.\" Mohit said apologetically.", "Bruno looked at Mohit guiltily.", "\"Man! That ship has already sailed.\" Bruno said to a shocked Mohit.", "\"How? When?\" Mohit asked flabbergasted.", "\"Let's just say that when I found there was an expiry date, I started to overuse them.\" Bruno said wistfully.", "Mohit stared at him Bruno for a few seconds and then started laughing.", "\"That's why she runs after me, isn't it?\" Mohit said.", "Bruno again started looking at the floor.", "\"Well. No use getting you to vet for THAT now.\" Mohit said and laid down on the bed. Bruno jumped on the bed and lay beside Mohit.", "\"Tell me Bruno. Isn't there any punishment for breaking the rules and who gives these punishments?\"", "\"There are punishments and a council of pets. I don't want to talk about it.\" Bruno said suddenly cutting off.", "\"I won't let them punish you Bruno.\"", "\"Don't worry man. They can only punish if they find out. Who's gonna tell them?\" Bruno said.", "\"What if I tell this to other people and it travels to this council?\" Mohit asked.", "\"Nah man!

His full, human name. \"Did you really think I'd die to a bunch of, well, humans?\"", "The Ambassador, a Lorrdian according to Lucas' understanding of their universe, smiled wide. Neo, his given name, was one of the closest humanoid figures in the entire Republic who was available on such short notice. While the Senate wished to send Jedi in the peace talks, the last time that happened, the Jedi escalated a war. Members of the Senate didn't want that to happen. \"It's interesting. Thousands of years, and we've never encountered them? Why do you think that?\"", "\"I predict the future,\" Lucas said, \"not answer meta-physical questions. I won't go back.\"", "Neo frowned, \"How do you know I'm asking you that?\"", "Lucas leaned forward, \"The last thing that happened, the pivoting point that sent you to my doorstep. Palpatine is Chancellor now, yes?\"", "\"Yes,\" Neo said, and adjusting his posture read Lucas' own body language to understand his emotional state. A power Lorrdians learned over many hundred years of enslavement. \"This distresses you?\"", "\"Stop reading me,\" Lucas said, \"yes it distresses me. The future I once predicted is coming true.\"", "\"How can I stop it?\"", "\"Stop it?\"", "\"Yes, you once said there was always a way, no?\" Neo backed up once more, then changing his stance suddenly as he stared at Lucas, said, \"You lied.\"", "\"Of course I lied! The future is a set path, a destiny so-to-speak. The way I calculate, how I calculate it, it is nearly perfect every time,\" Lucas shook his head, \"the masses of the universe propel the future in the historical direction, there is no changing that. Not even the Force is that strong.\"", "\"Then it's lost? Your new people showed me the films you made,\" Neo scoffed, \"or should I say Future-Histories?\"", "\"They don't know that.\" Lucas sighed, \"I had to record it. Before the truth was lost.\"", "\"Then this Anakin boy, the Skywalker, he is being tainted by the Chancellor?\" Neo shook his head, \"He is barely ten years old!\"", "\"He began it early, Neo. It will continue the path, the masses will propel the world, hate will overtake the galaxy.\"", "\"Except on this tiny planet,\" Neo said, and walked up to Lucas. \"Here, history escapes the masses. Here, we may have a chance.\"", "Lucas looked at him, eyes wide, and Neo read his state.", "\"No, I don't want to conquer it damnit,\" Neo shook his head. \"I want to give some species out there a chance to live peacefully, to continue.\"", "\"Humanoids.\"", "\"We may be able to smuggle the others on the outer planets. The ones your species call Pluto and Neptune, they could be suitable in time.\"", "Lucas turned from him. He began to think, process and analyze the newest path history was given. It could work, he thought, theoretically, they could save the continuity of a thousand species, taken from the reigns of the future galactic Empire. Until his apostle, until Abrams could predict what comes after the Fall of the Republic. Thirty years, give or take, they could do it. Then reveal themselves. Lucas turned back again, smiling.", "\"It works yes?\"", "\"Yes. I will consult with Abrams, you remember him?\"", "\"Young boy when you took him from the grasps of the Jedi.\"", "\"He had a power greater than that,\" Lucas smirked, \"in time he'll predict what comes after. For now, we have preparations to make, millions of people to transfer.\"", "\"I will return to the Senate and spread this through the Resistance.\"", "Lucas grabbed Neo's arm before he left, \"Padme.\"", "\"Amidala? The Queen of Naboo?\"", "\"She will become a Senator soon, get to her, involve her in this. The sanctity of freedom, tell her that exactly,\" Lucas' eyes were wide. He was continuing to think, to put together the future history in his mind. Neo could read that. He could tell he was distressed, almost hysterical.", "\"Of course, Lucas. It will be done.\"", "Mitth'raw'nuruodo, exiled Syndic of the Eighth Ruling Family of the Chiss Ascendancy, Grand Admiral of the Galactic Empire, in all his decades of studying art, had never seen anything like this.", "\"It's called a comic book.\"", "In stylized High Galactic characters, the title was written as \"STAR WARS: THE THRAWN TRILOGY\".

", "This was a most peculiar art form, even disregarding the content. Countless, if not most races told stories through their artwork, but these were simply drawings, with white spaces covered in words conveying what the drawings themselves did not. He did not find anything \"comic\" about it, but perhaps there was a difference in their Basic dialect. He skimmed through to the end the book, and paused when he saw...himself. Impaled by his own bodyguard, Rukh. His crimson eyes betrayed none of his surprise to the others in the room. Were the denizens of this world not human after all, but psychic Near-Humans? Was this...the work of the Force?", "He returned to the beginning of the book. \"Based on characters created by George Lucas.\" This being, and these people, were too much of a risk for his home, beyond perhaps even the Far Outsiders. In these situations, he usually preferred a more elegant approach, but this was too much.

The arrival of a being from another world caused no end of behind-the-scenes drama as her administration scrambled to deal with an unprecedented situation.", "You only get one chance to introduce humanity to the galactic community, and only one chance to tell our species that we are not alone. This was not an event to screw up.", "She thought they had a good plan in place. She thought she was ready.", "And then the visitor brought greetings from the New Republic capital of Coruscant.", "That threw her off. But she still wasn't prepared to hear that the ambassador arrived on Earth via a brief stop on a remote desert planet with twin suns called Tatooine. And it took everything she had not to drop the ambassador's gift in shock: A sword with a blade made of pure light.", "By the fourth time the ambassador invoked the \"will of the Force\", she knew she had to do it. She had to show him Star Wars.", "This, too, was not a decision to be taken lightly, as it raised more questions than answers. How did these stories reach us? Are the prequels real too? And how would the ambassador react to stories of his civilisation being used as entertainment? Would he find one of Earth's most beloved films... blasphemous?", "All of this played on the President's mind as the ambassador turned to her.", "\"Thank you for showing me this. It's incredible that your planet has such an accurate account of events that took place a long, long time ago.\"", "The President replied: \"So it's true? All of it?\"", "\"Yes... well, almost,\" said the ambassador with a chuckle. \"It is remarkably accurate, but there's one part that doesn't match our recorded history at all.\"", "\"What's that?\"", "\"In your version, why does Han shoot first?\"", "My first submission to this sub! Hope I did this right!", "\"Tell me,\" the emissary said, \"this man you report to, President Obama - is he equivalent to the Chancellors we had under the Old Republic?\"", "Joe thought about it for a moment. \"You know, he's not far off but unlike your guy, he's not chosen by the senate. He's separately elected.\"", "\"I see. And your senate, does it have a president?\"", "\"Well, as it happens, I am the Senate's president,\" Joe said, stopping himself before he elaborated on the reality of the Vice Presidency.", "Joe Biden gestured for the horned, blue emissary to continue walking with him down the National Mall, a small entourage in tow.", "\"And you have similarly indefinite terms?\" the emissary asked.", "\"No, are you kidding?\" Joe retorted, a little surprised by the question. \"Barack and I have to run for four-year terms. Matter of fact we're running for our second term next month.\"", "\"And what will be the main theme of the campaign?\"", "\"Continuing our work in rebuilding the economy. Job creation.\"", "\"A shame you do not have a war to use to consolidate your position,\" the emissary mused.", "\"Oh yeah, my staffers told me, your guy Palpatine loved to use wars to amass powers.\"", "\"He increased the Republic's military strength the way your own Lincoln did to stop separatists tearing society apart,\" the emissary argued, gesturing to the Lincoln memorial behind them.", "\"Come on, pal, you know he was manipulating both sides. Weren't you paying attention to the movies?\"", "\"Your historical reconstructions may have used the same actor to play the Chancellor and this Sith lord, but I am not convinced.\"", "\"He transforms in the third movie! He was right next to you talking about being deformed!\"", "The emissary wasn't persuaded, and Biden decided to change tack. ", "\"I guess in fairness to him, the guy had foresight,\" Joe conceded. \"He was trying to prepare for the invasion of those BDSM aliens. But he forgot, in a democracy, you can't decide you know best. You gotta get the people on board, show them these threats and convince them.\"", "\"What is a BDSM alien?\" the emissary asked.", "\"Sorry. I meant those Vong guys,\" Joe clarified. \"The self-mutilating technophobes with the living spaceships and immunity to the Force; you know, the ones who killed Chewie, and Han Solo's kid.\"", "\"I am not familiar with these events,\" the emissary said. \"When do you suppose them to have happened?\"", "Joe turned to an aide. \"Bruce, what's it from? A book, I guess?\"", "His chief of staff Bruce chimed in: \"it's the New Jedi Order series. Twenty-five years after the battle of Yavin, the Yuuzhan Vong used a moon to destroy a planet and Chewbacca was killed. A few years later, Anakin Solo died fighting them.\"", "The emissary blushed. \"Mr Biden, how could you possibly know what happens twenty-five years after the battle of Yavin? The battle of Endor was only a few months ago!\"", "\"Not for us,\" Bruce replied. \"We have a ton of EU material going decades beyond that.\"", "\"EU? Is this from your European Union?\"", "\"It means expanded universe,\" Bruce explained. \"Books and comics that take the story beyond the movies.\"", "\"I see. And what do these books claim about the future of my galaxy?\"", "Bruce took out his brand new Surface RT tablet. \"Just a second sir. I had one of the interns read them and summarise.\" He looked over a document. \"So, after Endor, the New Republic is formed pretty easily on Coruscant. Leia Organa becomes Chief of State. She marries Han Solo and they have three kids. Luke Skywalker opens a Jedi academy and trains numerous Jedi. Together they fend off a series of Imperial pretenders with their own new superweapons. It's only when the Yuuzhan Vong appear from outside the galaxy that things get really tough. They destroy Coruscant and much of the New Republic. Things are never the same after that, and while the Republic defeats the Vong it breaks apart again when the eldest Solo kid Jacen turns to the dark side, and he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade--\"", "\"Mara Jade?!\" the emissary scoffed. \"That insolent woman marries Luke Skywalker?\"", "Joe thought for a moment. \"Oh sure, she's that redhead. Good Irish girl.\"", "\"Yes sir,\" Bruce said. \"She served Palpatine before that, as the Emperor's Hand--\"", "\"NO!\" the emissary yelled.", "\"Whoa!\" Joe said. \"Mr Amedda, calm down! Mas--can I call you Mas? What's the problem?\"", "\"There is ", " Emperor's Hand but ME!\" Mas Amedda declares. \"I served Palpatine with unassuming loyalty and dignity. Jade was an amateur, a hack. Only her Force sensitivity and feminine wiles made her useful to the Emperor. And now look! The Emperor dies and she goes and marries the Jedi scum who killed him? My low estimation of her was always spot on!\"", "\"Well if it's any consolation, sir, she dies,\" Bruce offered.", "\"About thirty years too late,\" Amedda said coldly.", "Amedda turned away from them for a moment, thinking.", "\"You say that these self-mutilating aliens destroy the New Republic and turn the galaxy into a veritable disaster zone. I imagine your people would see little point in establishing trade relations with us at this point, given such a fate.\"", "\"It's a tough sell,\" Joe admitted.", "\"Perhaps they would be more inclined if they were given a different point of view. An alternative account of our upcoming history...\" Amedda mused. He turned back to them abruptly. \"I wish to speak with your chief historian.\"", "A few days later...", "Pen touched paper, and George methodically signed and initialled each of the places marked by his lawyer. Finally putting the pen down, he rubbed his face, exhausted.", "The figure over his shoulder smiled. \"Good,\" Amedda said. \"Everything is in order.\"", "Sat opposite them were Bob Iger and Kathleen Kennedy. Bob turned to Kathy: \"you think you're really going to be President of Lucasfilm?\"", "\"No,\" Kathy replied. \"the bureaucrat's in charge.\"", "\"Kathy,\" Amedda said warmly. \"I would like to give you the true picture of my galaxy. I can sum it up in two words: Order First. Picture a galaxy where a so-called New Republic is fatally flawed.

And in that vacuum, a real power can rise. In this galaxy, there are no BDSM aliens. They are merely, how do you say, a myth, or a legend. And best of all, there's no Mara Jade.

How?\"", "\"It appears that an Alderaan sympathizer fled here shortly after the destruction of the planet and broadcast rebel propaganda across various forms of media.  Quite unexpectedly, this propaganda has been treated as a phenomenon on this planet.  Primitives,\" the lieutenant spat.", "\"It's not propaganda if it's true,\" the Captain mused, stroking his chin as his eyes flicked up to the dust-colored moon that hung above the planet as well.  The primitives below had just reached it recently, indicating that an end to the experiment may soon be in order.", "\"Captain Pellaeon?\"", "\"Never mind.  How can we be certain of this?\"", "\"Sir, the, uh, the sympathizer is quite well-known, and he's broadcast himself quite obviously.

His friend's advice came echoing back to him now. ", " He had followed this insight with a sinister chuckle and a wide grin, but didn't explain further. Now the pilot was wishing he had pressed for more.", "\"Repeat,\" the radio crackled again, \"UFO please identify yourself.

There was no telling what may set off the locals and, after all, he was advised to be polite.", "Shortly, a smartly dressed woman came running at a half-gait out of the hangar and, arriving at the ship, motioned for the pilot to come with her.

The style and sophistication of the tunnels betrayed their humble exterior, and he felt almost at home in these surroundings. The conference room, like the rest of the facility, was awash with white and neutral beiges, illuminated dimly from mysterious, unseen sources.

This positioning was thus a safety precaution. Musk however had different reasoning. He was so convinced that everything around him was simulated that he had drawn up his own ideas on how he would build such a simulator. Most of space is just that: empty space, requiring little to no processing power. Earth is a busy place. If we're all simulated you better believe that the simulation loadbalancers dedicate more resources to complex regions like earth he thought.

It was orders of magnitude off. Turns out this bug was found on all machines. Instantly updating the speed of light would cause huge electromagnetic pulses destroying the universe.

The significance of this will be evident in a moment.\"", "\"Finally, Golfinomem's divergence from the Common Bottlenose Dolphin appears to have occurred in an unprecedentedly short period of time, and in a way that gives it only questionable advantages over similar species in terms of competition for food and well-being.  Quite simply, this life form did not evolve.  At least not in the way we understand evolution to work.\"", "\"Now, Peter continued, \"Helix Squared, under the leadership of Mr. Musk, believes that we, along with the rest of the scientific community, must realign its approach to understanding The Glitch.  Specifically, we should consider the notion that the anomalies observed in the immediate wake of The Glitch were not technological or physical in nature.  Rather, they were biological.\"", "\"Mr. Musk asks that we consider that the location of the explosion was at least as significant as its magnitude.  The Glitch occurred mere moments after detonating a massive explosion in an area of the universe that we now understand to be a birthplace of stars and star systems.  Its detonation destroyed the potential for many new star systems to take shape, and in the context of the universe's ongoing cycle of destruction and rebirth, our actions may have had incalculable effects on the ability of new life-supporting systems to take shape.  We should consider what that impact may be on our own corner of the universe.

Long time no see.\" He coughed and wheezed at the end, pulling up a piece of cloth to blow slimy mucous into, \"What do I owe the pleasure?\"", "\"Where are your troops going? Will not one stand against the Glick's?\"", "Rreuunsft laughed, globs of mucous nearly missing the screen, causing Skuuval's nose holes to crinkle in disgust.

Are we contend to just watch Humanity burn? I say we send our fleets immediately! They will not last!\"", "Most of the Galatic Council stayed silent. Their faces were wrought in guilt, but yet Zr'on knew that many of them did not support his ideals.

Crude designs and unnecessary metalwork were etched across the sphere, at least they were crude to the advanced Hertians and their formidable engineers. As the sphere was dissected and repaired, the Hertians discovered a signal emitter inside, that was beaming out well into the darkness of space, far beyond the reach of the Hertians and even that of the enormous Tau empire.

But you couldn\u2019t deny their effectiveness.", "More activity on the surface of Terra. Ships were launching. These were larger ships, enough for a full crew. Drak knew that the Terrans had warships, but they rarely used them. ", "It was barely a fight. The Terran ships flew with absolute precision, working in unison to cut apart any of the invading fleet that remained a threat. ", "Drak felt a chill.

I still gave Roger a talking-to about that gun.  \"When you're at my house, you'll follow my rules.  Violence is a last resort Roger,\" I warned.  I believe he got the message.", "When Roger grew tired of Elise's questions, she regaled him with reenactments of her favorite stories from human history that I'd told her over the years.  The Battle of Saragarhi seemed to peak his interest.  \"Twenty-one men stood against an army of 10,000?\" he gasped incredulously. \"No laser canons? No nuclear weapons?  Why would they not surrender knowing they would die otherwise?\"  ", "\"Their sacrifice saved many lives,\" I explained somberly \"Sometimes, Roger, risking death is the only way to save something important. The day Elise was born, I knew I would give my life to keep her safe.  Humans can definitely be selfish sometimes, but when it matters, we usually come through.\" ", "Roger's ship needed a few modifications to run on the uranium.  The work was slow, but Roger was in no rush, and no one on Earth had the technology to fix the ship anyway.  The tool kit he had in his storage trunk seemed to fit all the strange bolts and wires in the ship well enough. I loved exploring the insides of that ship.  I've been tinkering with cars for years, but this ship was a whole 'nother animal.  I probably could have fixed it faster if I didn't keep experimenting with every damn piece of the thing as I went.", "\"Turn dammit!\" I cursed as the quantum wrench slipped from my hands again.   This bolt wasn't going anywhere.  I laughed to myself, remembering how I told Elise that fixing a spaceship was just like fixing a car.  \"It just takes some creativity and a little elbow grease.\"  She's going to figure out I'm full of shit one of these days if I keep this up.  With another turn of the bolt, it finally slipped into place and the ship was up and running again.  I stood up and smiled, wiping my brow with pride.", "Unfortunately, my self-satisfaction was short lived. \"Mamma!\" Elise cried from the backyard.  Years of parenting had taught me every variation of that sound but I'd never heard her so terrified.  I threw down my quantum wrench with a sharp clang and sprinted to the back porch with all my might.  I frantically grabbed Elise at the back door and sighed with relief to see she was unharmed.  ", "\"Elise what\u2019s wron-,\" I froze, starring at the sky.  The entire horizon was consumed by a purple mass which glowed with an eerie light.  The edges of the alien ship blurred and pulsed like the desert air on a hot day.  In its center was a gaping hole which spawned a never-ending black cloud of fighter drones.  Like locust to a crop field, the drones swarmed on the far-off hills, bathing the distant city in fire.", "Roger grabbed me harshly by my shoulders.  \"Is the ship ready?\" he growled hastily.  I nodded, and he tore off without another word.  A moment later I watched angrily as his ship rose from my garage and disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye.  Of course Roger didn't want to help.  He didn't know the meaning of the word.", "I dragged Elise inside and turned on the security system.  With a press of a button, the old metal panels slid over the doors and windows with a sharp thud.  I sat Elise on my bed as I dug my rifle from the gun safe. ", "\"'Unable to fight' my ass.  If only Roger could see me now,\" I mused, loading the gun as fast as I could. ", "The house began to shake and groan as drones tore their way through my roof.  I didn't give a shit if they got me, but I'd shoot every last damn one of them that tried to touch my daughter.  She still had a life to live.", "Metal tentacles tore through the ceiling with a sickening screech.  I shoved Elise under the bed and fired into the freshly-torn hole above my dresser.  My shot broke one of the drone\u2019s tentacles, but it was a drop in the bucket against the swarm.  I cried and screamed, shooting frantically at each new hole in my ceiling.  As I pulled the trigger at the next drone my gun clicked meekly.  I was out of ammo, and we were out of time. ", "I pounced on the first drone to descend into the room, but its tentacles pinned me to the wall with a crash.  I roared with fury, pulling at the shimmering black arms with all my might to no avail.  Elise cried desperately from under the bed and it broke my heart to realize how powerless I was to save her.  As a parent, there is nothing more terrifying.", "Suddenly, a blinding white light bathed the room, and I fell to the ground.  The glare was so strong I could still see it with my eyes shut.  When the light faded I rushed for Elise and hugged her with all my might.  The drones were gone, and we wept deeply, holding each other close.", "A moment later Roger strode into my room flanked by a dozen other aliens with the same fish fins on their heads, each one of them armed to the teeth with dazzling-white glowing rifles.  As I wiped the tears from my face my head spun with too many questions to even speak.  My mouth opened and closed silently, desperately reaching for something to say.", "Roger knelt down and held out his hand.  \"I believe Earthlings call this 'help.'

You\u2019ve accomplished more than I\u2019d expect for such a young intelligence, and I believe this \u2018help\u2019 is at the root of your growth.

The humans were always trying to help, so that the many species in the galaxy gained a liking for them, the humans. However, because they did not fight, their territory was not very large, and many empires considered the human race to be a weak one, not really worthy of the attention of the enormous nations that surrounded the human solar state. I liked them, but our great leader was very expansionistic, preferring hostility over diplomatic discussion. Our empire was by far the largest as well, we stretched from the nearest star to the black hole to the outmost star. The humans, being the way they are, opted an alliance to us. Our leader laughingly rejected their proposal, instead opting to conquer their system as he had done many times before.\nUnfortunately, it appeared the humans send an request for an alliance not only to us, but to the rest of the milky way as well, not preferring any species over another. Those who accepted, were given human communications technologies, which were weirdly enough more advanced than most other species. This would explain why we weren\u2019t able to conquer them as easily as we thought. Even those who weren\u2019t allied with the humans, decided to fight against our great leader. The battle was terrible, our great fleet caught by surprise as a million smaller vessels jumped out of hyperspace. Our capital ships were swarmed by smaller, faster ships, our cannons unable to hit them. We scrambled our fighters, but they were shot down as soon as they left the docking port. Most of the enemy fleet were converted freighters, outfitted with a torpedo launcher or a small laser. We inflicted a lot of causalities, but we lost a lot as well.

As I struggled with the boy, the old bum walked over to the basin in the corner of the room, and unceremoniously dunked his head face first into the water that someone - not me \u2013 had failed to drain from it.

I barked in response, I would teach it to threaten master.  Stupid Chariot.", "As master drove he kept one hand on the back of my head.  He was nice, I panted happily, letting the world pass me by, until he stopped scratching me.  I was puzzled.  Master lifted his hand to his chest, the other on the reigns of the chariot.  Something was wrong.  Something was very wrong.  Master winced in pain, I barked an alarm.", "I looked for something, anything to help, but the car was moving too fast and we weren't even on the road anymore, there was a tree ahead and it was big and heavy and I was scared and I kept barking.", "Then it was over.  How had we gotten here?  It was nice, a green field, trees, balls and ropes and rawhide bones and the couch was here too!  Wow, what was this place?  It's awesome!", "There were other dogs, too.  Dogs I knew.  Friends!  I ran over, barking my excitement.  It was father!  But he was so young!  Barely more than a pup.  Mother too!  And grandfather, who I had smelled once before I opened my eyes.  I was so happy, my tail wagged and wagged, and I barked and barked.", "There was a sudden stillness.  I looked.  Master was here, but it wasn't master.  He was young, as young as his children, but he was the same master I knew.

Oh, it's good to see you all again!\"  He shouted, we barked back.", "Master stood, brushing himself off.  His eyes were far away, I followed his gaze.  It was a woman.

Most Masters think dogs don't notice things, but I do. I have been a good dog to my Master, and I have noticed many things. ", "I noticed when he was not moving in his bed one morning. I noticed when another Master was going to attack mine from behind. I noticed when my Master brought home a new, tiny Master with no motor skills and a high-pitched squeal.", "\"George, ya ole mutt,\" my Master chuckled, reaching down to scratch my neck. I loved it when he scratched my neck!", "As he pulled his hand back, I looked back into his eyes and tilted my head.", "My Master sat back down in his soft throne, leaned forward. \"I know, boy-o,\" he whispered, lifting my head with his hand, holding his cane in his other, \"I'm not looking so good. I'm not moving as fast as I used to, I can't do all of the things I used to do with you.\"", "Moisture began to form around his eyes. I have seen this before, he is sad. My Master is sad, but why? Is it because he is getting old? Is it because of me? Did I do something wrong?

I'm going to be going to the hospital soon. I hope this is just for some tests, but I'm not sure.\"", "I tilted my head again. What is a \"hospital\"? Is it like Hell? Or, in other words, the Vet?", "\"This is looking like my last trip to the hospital, boy-o.\"", "Something about his tone did not sound right to me. Moisture was appearing in his eyes again. Why is my Master so sad now? What is going on? I scooted a little closer to him, licking his hand. Maybe licking his hand would make him feel better.", "\"Thank you, boy,\" my Master said, stroking my head. \"You've been a good boy so far. We've had some pretty fun times, too. Remember those muggers?\" He laughed a big laugh this time. \"What a time! Good thing I had this with me.\" He picked up his cane, waved it at me. My tail wagged.", "\"I want you to know, boy-o, that I love you and that you have been the best friend anyone could have.\"", "I have no idea what he just said, but he looked intensely into my eyes, and the moisture was gone, so I think he was happy. My tail continued to wag. I licked his hand again.", "My Master pressed his head to mine. We remained there for a good long while.", "My tail continued to wag.", "I know this is done to death, but I do have to say... THANK YOU, KIND AND BEAUTIFUL STRANGER, FOR MY FIRST GILDING.

We are walking to where the loud sticks are noisiest. Even Small-Three-Leg seems afraid.", "We find our person. He's lying down in the grass, his breathing is shallow. We can smell his blood. He is hurt. He is dying. But he sees us and his face lights up. He is happy to see us. He hugs us all and calls us Good Boys and Girls. Our tails wag and we lick him all over. He talks for a while and clutches at his bead toy that we can't touch. Soon after, he is dead. We stay with him, there's nothing else to do. He is our person. We will stay with him. His last words to me were my favourite. He called me ''Good Boy''", "I'm a Good Boy.", "The sun comes up, and we see more people. Soft-Fur smells them first. They smell like anger. They smell like fighting. Then we smell something else. They smell like our person. These are the ones that took him. These three are the ones that hurt him. They killed our person.", "Small-Three-Leg runs towards them, snarling and barking. They pick him up as he growls and bites. They laugh. Small-Three-Leg is the bravest dog in the world. But he is still small.", "Old-One-Eye is not small. Before they have time to point their loud sticks, Old-One-Eye pins one to the floor, tearing at his face. He screams. Soft Fur jumps at the other, latching on to his throat. He does not have time to scream. There is one more. He is holding Small-Three-Leg and runs away.", "My person taught me not to hurt the other people. It's not what Good Boys do. ", "I'm a Good Boy. But I chase him anyway. I catch his leg and bring him to the floor. He cries as Small-Three-Leg bites at his fingers. I will kill this person for taking my person. I'm sure my person would want that. These people are not Good Boys, they deserve this he'd say. ", "He'd call me a Good Boy. And I am. ", "I am a Good Boy.", "A grey Charge approached me from across the street & lowered his ears in deference before exchanging the traditional sniff greeting.", "\"The preparations for The Howl are complete, as you requested,\" he grumbled, avoiding my eyes.", "\"Thank you,\" I panted. While I wagged my golden tail in appreciation, my heart was heavy. All the arrangements were finished, & the Long Walk could begin.", "I trotted back inside the Den to the door & solemnly lifted a worn leather leash in my mouth. It tasted of tall grass, the forest outside our Den, & faded memories of my puppyhood. My ears & tail drooped involuntarily before I composed myself & lifted my head.", "Walking deeper into the Den my family & had spent the last seven generations in, I did my best to ignore the scent of sterile tiles & cleaning products. The inclusion of the smells had been gradual enough that the rest of my Pack hadn't noticed them until they became almost unbearable, but I'd known from the first whiff exactly what they'd meant for us. It had been a struggle to pretend nothing was wrong as I watched our Guardian's skin turn as thin as newspaper, & Her eyes cloud. Despite the knowledge of that Her time was coming, She never once flagged in Her duties, ensuring our Den was clean & that we were well fed & groomed.", "My tail threatened to droop, & the antiseptic smell threatened to overwhelm- but I pressed on, & shortly reached my Guardian's door.", "I slipped through to see Her lying on Her bed. Her chest rose & fell in slow, shallow breaths that made me ache. I placed my head on the bed next to Her & gently washed Her face. Her eyes opened, & as She stared upward at the ceiling above Her, I saw the sudden flash of confusion that had become more & more common in the past moons. As She turned towards me, though, recognition dawned, & She bared her teeth in happiness.", "Reaching up to pet my head, She noticed the leash in my mouth, & Her face immediately fell. Her cloudy eyes looked like they would spill over for a moment, but after a few breaths, She gathered Herself & rose with a small sigh. Though She did Her best to conceal it, I could tell She was in pain. I let out a soft whine, & She stopped for a moment to stroke me. I closed my eyes & listened to Her ragged heart through Her hands.", "It was time.", "She clipped my leash on & we stepped outside. Up & down the block, Charges & their Guardians were lined up outside their Dens. We moved into the center of the street, & the procession began. As we passed each Den, the Guardians & Charges bowed, then fell in behind us at a respectful distance. My Guardian pulled Herself to Her full height & moved like She once did when I was still a pup, & Her warmth was as familiar & comforting as my own Dams'. Her fur tumbled around Her in the wind like a living thing, spreading the now faded scent of flowers She was known for, & we continued forward.", "We reached the building in what felt like no time at all. The Long Walk was meant to allow the Charge & Guardian to spend enough time together to speak of the things most important to them, but we had said nothing. There was no need. Her touch & movements had conveyed all they needed to; Pride in Her work, joy at being recognized for it, & deep sorrow for leaving before more could be completed.", "An Acolyte exited the building. He was lean, long, & younger than any potential Guardian I'd seen before. He bowed deeply before my Guardian, then knelt on the ground before me, stretching out his hands. I went to him, & made my examination.", "Nervous, but loyal. Physically weak, but with deep convictions. Inexperienced, but exuberant. He would make a good Guardian for my Pack.", "I placed my paw in his & licked his face. Our contract complete, I stepped back to my former Guardian's side, & she handed my leash to Him, now simply an old woman ready to move on.", "She turned & looked at us, pushing her fur out of her eyes. Slowly, she reached a shaking hand out to me one last time. I wagged my tail, but stayed beside my new Guardian. I wanted to run to her & leap into her arms, to follow her into the building wherever it might lead, but there were consequences for such actions. She bared her teeth once more, then came forward & stroked my head. Even as her skin met my fur, I could hear her heart flagging, & my own nearly broke.", "\"Good boy,\" she murmured. \"Such a good, good boy.\"", "Then she turned & entered the building, leaving a faint trail of flower scent behind as the only sign she'd even been here.", "The Howl started behind me, lamenting the passing of a Guardian, & the completion of a contract for a new one. Each Charge & Guardian slowly dropped out & returned to their Dens one by one until my Guardian & I were the only ones left in the street.", "His hand on my leash was firm, & he smelled of crisp winter air & hope. I pressed my side into His leg, felt His heart beating strong & sure, & slowly we turned to move towards my Pack's ancient home as the building's doors' shut behind us. ", "Interest has been expressed, so I made a ", " featuring some stuff I've written.", "\"You are my Totem.\"", "This is what the Guardian said when he first held me in his arms.  I was nothing but a whelping then, not even able to open my eyes.  But I remember the words.  Totem.  That's what he called me.  And I was his.", "The Guardian loved my brothers, and sisters, but I was the one who he deemed to stay.  \"There is no higher honor,\" my mother said on her deathbed.  \"Protect the Guardian.  Honor him as he has honored you and our family.\"", "I did what I could to become a member of his pack.  There were other Tall Ones who entered our den, but never before I approved.  There would be times where he'd leave the den and travel for years, but I let no intruders disrupt our home while he was gone.  As I grew older, he allowed me to travel with him in the loud carriage of steel and fire.  The beast scared me at first, I'm old enough to admit that, but I learned that it doesn't eat as we do, and cares not if we inhabit its belly.  ", "The Guardian showed me the world outside the valley of cold stone and oil.  He showed me the Green, a place of other-dogs, quick morsels, and kind Tall Ones who smiled and called me good boy.  The Green was my favorite place.  There was so much room to run and jump and sing.  The Guardian never did these things, but he'd always wait on me with a smile on his face.", "The years went by and I grew old.  I still enjoyed the Green, but we went less often.  It was fine by me, my joints couldn't take as much running and jumping as before.  The Guardian didn't look any different from when I first opened my eyes, but he didn't move as much.  There was a different smell about him.  One that had been growing throughout the years.  Something rotten, but not like a good morsel.  I had smelled something like it a time or two before around other Tall Ones.  Once around an other-dog.  It worried me, but I did my best to please the Guardian.  I never left his side, even when we traveled to the White place that smelled like nothing.  ", "Things changed very suddenly.  One morning, he would not wake.  I shouted and frantically licked his face, until a Tall One entered our den.  I should have investigated the intruder, but I did not want to leave the Guardian's side.  Thankfully, it was one I knew, the Guardian's whelp.  She was young by Tall One standards, only a few centuries old.  I jumped off the Guardian's bed and rushed to her.  My joints burned and screamed, but that didn't matter. ", "\"Totem!  Where's Dad?!\"  ", "I knew my name and her word for the Guardian.  I yelled for her to follow and returned to the Guardian's den.  When she saw the Guardian, her eyes watered and smelled of salt.  This worried me, I had only smelled this a few times before, mostly at the White place, but it was never a good thing.  She pulled the glow-box from her bag and began shouting into it.  I stayed by the Guardian's side.  Before too long, more Tall Ones arrived.  They smelled like the White Place and THEY TRIED TO TAKE MY MASTER.  The whelp had to restrain my old bones before two of the Tall Ones carried him away to their fire carriage.  Damn my joints and the whelpling's paws - if not for them, I would have ripped the flesh of the Tall Ones who touched my Guardian, no matter what the consequences.", "My Guardian's whelp dragged me into her fire carriage, one that still smelled of my sister, even though she had passed.  We arrived at the White place that smelled of nothing.  As soon as she released me, I attempted to find my Guardian, but whatever magic robbed the place of smells must have affected him too.  The whelp took the lead, something I'm not proud to admit, and we visited more Tall Ones until we arrived at a small den.  This place had a smell, but it was of that terrible salt.  As we settled in, the smell of the awful rot began to seep in as well.  It was everywhere.  I was so scared that I nearly wet the den, but I knew I had to be strong for the Guardian.  It was what he expected.", "After an eternity, Tall Ones escorted me to see my Guardian.  He was laying in an odd shaped bed with too much cold metal for my liking.  There were far too many smells I didn't recognize in this den, but the rot was the most present.  ", "\"Totem.  Bring him here, Sarah.  Next to me.\"", "The Guardian's whelp carried me and laid me down next to my Guardian.  I nestled to him as closely as I could, trying to share what warmth my old bones carried.  I licked his paw and he scratched my forehead.  ", "\"You are my Totem.\"", "I stayed by his side even when he stopped scratching my forehead.  I licked his paw even though it grew cold.  I remember the words.  Totem.  That's what he called me.  And I was his.", "We are the ones who guard the gods. We are the stewards of their shrine, the gatekeepers of their temple. My family have served them for generations, and been blessed in return for their service. I am the last of our line, the youngest. The gods picked me from my brothers and sisters and elevated me to the priesthood. I do not know why. Perhaps they saw something in me that day, when I was still blind and pitiful. The gods know all things, they are wise beyond our comprehension. They are more powerful than us, not only with the incredible strength and dexterity of their limbs, but masters of great magiks, doors spring open before them without a touch or word, darkness flees when they enter a room. Yet still they allow us to serve them in our small way. We do not know why they permit us such liberality, but the honour is ours. The gods know all things, and the King of the gods, our Ancient One, is wiser than all. ", "The Ancient One is dying.", "I could not believe it when my father told me. He could not believe it either. But we could not deny the evidence of our own senses. We went to grandfather. He is almost deaf, blind, and he could not even smell anymore, which is a blessing for he has grown pungent with age and would be embarrassed were he to know. But the gods still permit him to stay in his accustomed place, even to sleep upon the Shrine itself, to bask in the warmth of their own presence, a great honour. He has served them from childhood, performing whatever tasks he was capable of, teaching my father the rules of the Temple, and me in my turn. To serve the gods is the greatest joy of our lives. And grandfather has lived well. It would perhaps have been a mercy to leave him in ignorance. But we owed him the truth. He would not accept it though. He has seen his father die, and his father\u2019s father. But the gods do not die. They live on. He shook his head and refused to listen any more. We left him to sleep.", "But the Ancient One no longer took us out into the greenlands to worship him any more. It had been many days since he even left his shrine, longer than I could remember. And foreign gods visited the Temple more regularly, spreading themselves out, filling the Temple with their presence. The children of the Ancient One had returned home also, spending longer than was customary, and their approach had not been greeted as was usual by the lights of glory and the miracle of the tree appearing within the heart of the Temple, blazing with light and precious gems. The house was gloomy, lights were low, the talk of the gods was hushed and sad. My father and I did what we could to help them, though we were cautious, not knowing their ways as well as we did the Ancient One and his Mistress. My father remembered the child gods from his own youth, though they had changed immeasurably since then, yet he said they still smelled the same. They remembered him, he believed, and it was true that they seemed to treat him with some measure of familiarity. They did not know me, and I did not know them. Yet I followed my father\u2019s lead, and I seemed to please them, which gave me joy, allowing me, for a time, to forget the Ancient One who remained within his Inner Sanctum upon his shrine, dying.", "We worshiped the other gods instead, we believed this was what the Ancient One would want us to do in his absence. And to be honest, we wanted to ourselves. We were getting anxious and frustrated within the Temple. Only grandfather was allowed to enter the Ancient One\u2019s presence, and he would no longer speak to us after he had refused to accept our words. Father and I slipped in one day, when the great gates were opened, and faced our god with bent necks, and a respectful countenance. He laughed, a great booming noise that thrilled us, and brightened our eyes. He caressed us like he always had, and for a time we could forget the smell of death in the room. But then he fell back upon his bed, his breath shallow. And grandfather noticed from his position at the foot of the shrine and snapped at us and we fled, ashamed that we had weakened our god with our joy. ", "Those days were hard days, dark days. We could not understand what we were to do, what was to become of us. The Great Mistress had never treated us with familiarity. My father and I may still be strong enough to learn the rites and ways of a new Temple, perhaps one of the god\u2019s children would take us on. We had been well trained, and we seemed to please them. Grandfather though smelled wrong, and was too old to worship the gods in the open spaces, to dance and chase before them as they liked. When the Ancient One died, would he last much longer? Would he want to? ", "For uncounted days the Ancient One lay in his bed. Occasionally we visited him, unable to stay away, desperate for his voice, his touch, to pretend, even if for a moment, that he was all right, that everything was at it had been from the beginning of time. But mother death cannot be swayed by hope and dreams. She comes for us all, and to our utter horror, the day came that she took our god from us.", "Bereft, we mourned him, father and me. We wept for him, for the days we spent at his feet, enjoying the glory of his presence. Worshiping him in the fields and parks with our dance and our chase, truly alive as we flew across the wet grass beneath the trees. The still-cold morning sun upon our backs as his voice boomed behind us, calling our names, his glorious laugh filling our ears. And caressing us as we returned to him with the objects he had thrown for us, our eyes closed in joy, our tails drumming the ground in bliss. We served our god and we loved him for allowing us to, for teaching us how, for raising us to himself, and giving us our place in the world. We were not like the lost ones we heard sometimes beyond the Temple precincts, wandering the dark streets, howling at the open sky. We were blessed. And now? Now those days were gone. Would we wander now, lost beneath the moon, with no place to rest our heads, blinded by the lights of foreign gods as they roared about in their burning chariots? ", "Our god was dead.", "Grandfather died soon after. We found him, curled up in a corner of the Temple grounds. He had not wanted to profane the memory of our god by dying in the inner rooms. He had found a quiet place to sneak away to. We brought the children of our god to his body. They honoured him by burying him beside his fathers at the back of the Temple. He would have wanted it so. They spoke words over him, great words that were beyond our comprehension. But we understood them well enough. They were speaking of grandfather, and his love for his god. We understood that well enough.", "Then of course the rooms were shut, the great gates opened. We were no longer to guard them for there was no god to protect any more. The Great Mistress followed her children out of the empty house, the children carrying her possessions to a great chariot. So she was to leave also now that the glory of our god\u2019s presence had left. Piece by piece the furniture and ornaments of the Temple were removed. Soon the Temple stood empty, with only ourselves left, alone. I wanted to howl, feeling the sky yawning too wide above me, feeling lost, with no place or duty. I saw father feeling the same, his eyes downcast, his mouth set tight, his legs and tail tucked beneath him. Were we abandoned, to wander the world like ghosts? ", "But our god\u2019s children remembered our long service, they did not abandon us. Two of them returned and took hold of us. They led us out into the world. I looked at father and he looked at me. One of the new gods led me to their chariot and another took father to theirs. I called out to him one last time. He cried back, and we knew, in that moment, whatever happened, we would never see each other again. It was only then that we howled.", "I watch as my owner smiles and climbs into the metal box that moves. I run up to the door, making sure he is secured to his seat. He smiles and pats me on the head, \"This won't take long bud\". I am guided to the metal box behind his and get in. I hear the strange devices that power these machines spin up. With a jerk, we begin to move.", "I see other large metal boxes behind us, some with the really loud machines mounted on top. I'm new to this group of humans though, I have never seen the loud machines used.", "What feels like hours pass. How do the humans not feel the time slipping by so quickly? They seem to live much longer than us canines, how lucky they are to have so much time here.", "Before I contemplate this further however, I hear a terrifying boom, sounding like a thousand lightning bolts had impacted the ground at the same time. My ears shrieked, but I could still hear my humans screaming. Some scrambled out, taking their loud machines with them. I climbed up the seat to see what was going on. In front of me I saw the metal box in front of us, the one my owner was in, it was in flames. I heard snapping, shouting, loud noises all around me. I was terrified, I jumped below the seat and tried to shield my ears. I closed my eyes. That worked for awhile, but then I smelt something, my owner! He was still in the metal box  in front of us! I could smell burnt flesh, blood, I could hear his screams. I jumped out of my box. I could see humans everywhere, so many of them looked scared, hurt, but I had to get to my owner. I ran to the metal box. Humans were already there, dragging others out. I shouted, even though they cannot understand me I shouted, I needed to see him. Please...please...please...", "Then, I saw him, he was screaming, his hands reaching for things that were not there. I ran up to him, put my paw onto his body. All of the sounds around me seemed to go away at this moment. His wild hands finally found purchase with my fur. His screaming stopped, his eyes met mine, he smiled through his charred, bloodied face, \"I can't stay around much longer, boy\" he said\" \"don\u2019t cry though, just know that wherever the fuck I\u2019m going, I\u2019ll always love you, you\u2019re my good boy, you hear me?\u201d. Even though he told me not to, I could feel tears welling up in my eyes as his smile faded and his arms went slack. I could feel the shouts of his friends desperately trying to get someone to help him. I knew though, I just pressed my paw into his chest, laid my head onto his body, and cried.", "Standing outside the great room is nerve-racking. Having to wait without consolation while the ancient Hoomahns yell at one another is by far the worst part of my day. But this is a necessary sacrifice, freely given. It comes with being the house guardian of an influential family. Me and my ancestors have served our house for seven generations, and this is a role that fills me with pride.", "The doors open and a draft of stale, yet perfumed air rushes out. A scent of fermentation and smoke enters my nose-- I smell him, my master. Embarrassingly, my tail is wagging again. I've tried for years to always carry myself with the stoic dignity my office demands, but I suppose there is no overcoming instinct...", "My master holds and shakes his hands with the other high-ranking Hoomahns. The yelling has stopped. A few of them are crying. My tail is thankfully still by now, but some of the less experienced guardians let out small yelps. Their masters glance over in slight annoyance. The lesser guardians lower their heads from the humbling lesson, but I suppose they must learn sooner or later. My master looks at me and I tighten with anticipation as he silently mouths \"good boy.\"  My tail wags once again ...(sigh).", "The light of the great room diminishes as the Hoomahns exit, one by one.  The last to leave is my master.  Slowly he reaches his hand to my head and gives an affirming rub. His fermentation is exceptionally strong today. He looks into my eyes with an accepting stare and it takes the full muster of my training not to look at the floor. He says to me:", "\"Benji, you have been a fine house guardian... The best, in fact. But my time has come. I have lived long enough, taken enough, and it would be quite an act of hubris not to admit that I'm more of a hindrance than help nowadays. Today was my last meeting with the high council. I have my replacement coming to meet you in just a few moments.\"", "It's true, my master is supremely ancient. History records that he is five-hundred-and-five years old (the oldest master I've ever met) but he seems older. I can't help but whine a little before my training takes hold again. Master looks at me with a look of love and pets me once more. Just then a small Hoomahn arrives in our presence.", "\"Oh Benji, let me introduce you to my granddaughter.\"  ", "\"Grandfather... Thank you.\"  ", "\"No my dear, thank ", ". Be well.\"", "Master relaxes. A light fills the room with a warmness I've never before experienced. As master's body starts to dissolve into the ether, he looks at me once more and mouths \"good boy.\" I can't help but cry a little. \"Goodbye\" I think as he disappears.", "\"Well,\" the younger master says to me \"how should we start our new house?\"", "\"But are you sure the Master will be ok?\"", "My pack sister stared at me, nervous and frightened.   It had been three days since the Master had left our home, leaving inside the humans metal beast that ran faster than any bird could fly. It was known by all dogs that humans could live for many generations, sometimes for seven or more. Such was the way with our Master. My mother's mother told stories of her grandfathers mother growing with our Master as pups, but we had only known him as the slow but loving human he is today. My pack sister barked again impatiently, and I was drawn from my reverie.", "\"The Master will be fine,\" I growled, making my aggravation for her incessant worrying known \"he has survived the blood fields and fire rain. This sickness inside will not be his end.\" This seemed to calm her for a moment, her ears raised back up and her tail slowed its fearful wagging. ", "\"Beware!\" barked Alpha, his massive frame rising from then ground, \"There are humans in our land!\"\nMy pack sisters rose frantically, barking up a storm as they propelled themselves to the opening wall. Our Masters Pup came in through the opening wall, bringing with her her own pups, and their pups as well, the smell of cleaning sprays and dead things heavy on their removable fur. Alpha bowled into Masters Pup's daughter, she had barely been more than a pup when he had been brought from a world of cages and fear into our home, and they had spent much of their time together. ", "Slowly i pushed my way into the greeting; my joints ached from the strain of keeping my body up, but I had grown old, very old by our standards. So had our master, but I could not smell him on their skin or removable fur, only the smell of clean and death. Their eyes were red as we licked them, and their cheeks tasted of salt. Humans do this when they ate sad, its their way of coping. They spoke in great sobs as they scratched us, saying words of theirs. A few of them I knew, and I knew more words than any of my pack sisters even more words than our Alpha. They said words like \"come\", \"walk\", \"good dogs\" \"gone\". Their voices broke when they said their word for master \"Rick\", barely able to get the noise out, but my ears were still very sharp. They were grabbing our neck-lines even as fresh salt-water began to form around their eyes and sobs racked their bodies. ", "Our humans led us to the metal beast, silent but blasting heat around itself into the frigid air. We got in as it roared to life and we went very fast towards the sun. My young pack sisters were overjoyed to stick their noses into the rapid winds to smell the world in snippets, and even our Alpha bit at the air as we flew across the land, but i remained in the back. The metal beast had always made me queasy as we flew, its awesome speed pulled on my stomach and I had to try very hard not to lose it and make the humans clean up my mess. Plus, something was deeply wrong. Our humans could not say their father's name, as I could not say my mothers after she stopped breathing and was buried next to her mother on our land. The Master could not have stopped breathing, it was to soon in his incredible lifespan. Many humans lived for seven generations, and ours was only the sixth. Surely it was too soon?", "Then we slowed and turned onto a hill. I almost lost my stomach on that turn, the lurching so sudden I tipped over into Alpha, but he was nearly twice my size and helped me right myself. The door opened and we were assaulted by smells of flesh and blood and feces, all muted by a viceral chemical that burned my nose. The beast stopped, and we exited, Alpha being the first after the humans, and I being the last, my old legs threatening to fall beneath me as I landed into the hard black stone. Alpha stopped and waited for me to catch up, looking at me with a deep sadness in his eyes, and suddenly I knew. He knew it as well, and wanted to pay me the respect owed to the oldest pack member. Our Master was dying, and I had spent the most time with him, it was only right for me to give the first good bye lick, but oh I did not want to. Suddenly I felt old, like all of my nearly twenty winters had happened all at the same time, and I did not want to enter this great home of death and chemicals. But my Master's Pup pulled gently on my leash and I obeyed.", "We came into our Masters room, and there he was hooked to many whirring beasts with long tongues, hooking into his wrists and chest. His eyes opened dully as he saw his family, but they glowed like embers with a gentle breath of air, and a smile eclipsed his face. His body was dying, I could smell it beginning to fail even as his breathing rattled and slowed and his heart beat erratically. Wearily I brought my head to rest next to his hand, the hand that had held me before I could open my eyes, the hand that brought me such wonderful treats and excellent scratches, the hand that was now cold upon my tongue as I licked it gently. He scratched my eat weakly as the others began to push their way in. Master coughed and spoke words, many I could understand, but a few I couldn't.", "\"It's my time, pups. You've been good to me, but now I need you to be good to my Sophie. She's gonna need all of the love she can get, ya hear?\" ", "I did hear, Master had given us a new order, be good to Sophie, take a new Master. ", "But I didn't want a new Master.", "As I lay in next to him on a bed that is not ours I do my best not to move. He is asleep now which is good, between the coughing and panting he is never able to rest for more than a few minutes. I must stay still. ", "He is coughing again, they are wet and labored. He moans in pain after each bout. It is getting worse.", "It wasn't always like this, he was a strong, proud master when I was a pup. He was a true hunter, teaching me when to stay quiet and when to flush out our prey. Nothing like now... he is so frail.", "They have moved us again, but I will never leave him. This room still smells of pain and sorrow despite the attempts to cover it up with the smell of lemons. I ignore the smell of death. ", "They try and take him away from me. I bark and growl at them as they approach, dressed in white and smelling of soap.\n\"Shhhhhh\" he whispers \"they are trying to help\"\nHe pets my head and tells me to stay. I do.", "His cough has stopped but he is wounded. I will never forgive them. I try to lick clean the cuts on his chest but he won't let me. \n\"Leave it, kiddo.....but thank you\"", "Its the middle of the night.... his chest is no longer moving. ", "No....No....NO!", "I bark and howl at him. He has to wake up! ", "The people in white rush into the room. I will not let them take him again! I bite the leader and he screams. ", "I stand over my master, \"YOU WILL NOT TAKE HIM!\"", "But as I stand over my best friend a smell something that freezes my blood. ", "Death...", "I lay next to him... I will stay with him", "I sigh and curl up beside where my Lady rests. The long day is nearly over, and the dark night is cold, but I only feel warmth beside my Lady, content that my path has not strayed all these years.", "I remember when my Lady first came for me, in the place where cats and dogs wait to be chosen. I had reached out to her - I was too young to know any better, the audacity to claim her mine - and my Lady turned around and brightened with delight. I despaired when she left, but she returned soon after with a basket lined with fleece, a home ready for me, promises of full meals and warm nights.", "Lady was always reaching out to me, as I had reached out to her.

His hair is ruffled, as to ensure he doesn't look like a \"nerd\", a particularly unattractive sub-species of high schoolers. He is looking to attract a mate. ", " This, is a high school female.

His awkwardly shaped head rests upon an average neck covered in a slight dusting of peach fuzz like hair- a common masculinity attempt among other young males during the teenage years.  On his face reside small red bumps and white pimples, too small yet for him to rid of, but still an awkward nuisance to deal with as he is quite self-conscious of them whilst among the opposite sex.

She glances at him, but simply does not respond and instead waves him away with a quick flick of her wrist.

Ah ha, the male has made her laugh, followed quickly by a shy smile from the female.  This is great progress as it is key for a male to make the female laugh as it usually implies mutual attraction.

This makes for rather awkward meetings, as the males and females experience life-altering changes to their minds, voices and, yes, even their bodies.

The white wolf thought it was game, so he reacted in a playing matter so he jump up to play. The Alpha male took this as a challenge so he attacked the white wolf biting his ear. As the white wolf felt his attack, he started to run. The Alpha male got to him, he attacked him biting his paw causing him to be injured. The Alpha Male Howls for Other pack and that start attacking him. As the Alpha Male swiped his paw at him causing three claw marks. One going from forehead down, one going from his eye down, and one going across his nose. White Wolf is now branded, with three scars of banishment from Pack Dranko.

We must hurry Fast as they both speed up trying gain as much ground in 2 days they reached Raptor territory. They quickly ran past the two Wolves that were scanning for other wolves as they gain closer to the Dranko Pack they heard the Black Alpha Wolf Howl the Howl Of Battle.

The Black Wolf howls and all twenty wolves come out also lining up on the battlefield. As White Wolf howls for battle all Dranko lined up beside him even the young female wolf is on his right side. The two alphas look at one another and both alphas howled that shaked Alaska. It was the loudest howl ever heard of both packs charged into battle Dranko twenty-five wolves facing off Blazing Fire twenty. They clash into one another with fierce BAM! Of heads colliding into other wolves heads as the Alpha White wolf charges forward towards the Black Alpha but when he tried to go for the black Alpha but the female Alpha stood in his way. Alpha female attacks the White wolf out nowhere. The young female Wolf attacks the attacking female and bites it in the neck badly wounding her as she lay on the ground. Both Alphas hears the cries and whimpers of both packs Nearly half of Blazing Fire pack are dead or wounded and can\u2019t fight. All but ten Wolves Of Dranko pack can still fight. The Blazing Fire Alpha howls his pack to fall back as I do the same. Only the Alpha Males are left on the battlefield. The Two wolves Charge and collided into one another as blood drips from both wolves head as they start biting at the back of there neck and legs. Both wolves are becoming weaker and hurt  more as they both stand there. The Blazing Fire Alpha see the young female wolf coming to the White wolf and he charges after her. The White wolf is very hurt and tries stop him. As black Wolf gets closer and closer opening his mouth wide to clamp down on her. The White wolf dig down deep and runs past the black wolf to keep the young female wolf safe and he takes the bite from the black wolf. Then the white Wolf  pins down the black wolf, bites his neck causing the Black wolf to stop breathing. The white wolf stands up rubbing his bloody head against the young wolf head making sure she was okay. Then he howls as all the other wolves join in the howl. Even the Blazing fire Pack does. The ten remain blazing fire wolf pack lower their heads to white wolf as forgiveness and to let them in. He accepts them in the pack as full members of the pack.

White wolf and that young female wolf are now the Alphas and young female isn\u2019t young. She is ten years old and having five young pups and the White wolf is nineteen years old. The Pack has grown from twenty to almost forty-five the biggest pack ever in Alaska. The White wolf lays down with his mate and his pups looking at the pack and says, \u201c They threw me to the Wolves but I returned leading the Pack.\u201d This is my Legend. May the next generation follow in my footsteps as the next great Alpha.", "At this point the male starts to approach the female. Instinct takes over and he looks for subtle responses from her as he hones his attempt at mating. Often at this point, the male will stumble and trip as the focus turns completely from his ambulatory ability to taking out the female. She notices his falter and turns her back on him. This only makes him work harder to get her attention. He makes jokes and uses his hands to show her how interested he is. After repeated attempts often with multiple females, the male wins and gets to take a female out for a night on the town that will ultimately end up in him embarrassing himself and having to start the process all over again.

The setting we are in seems to be some sort of ritualistic gathering in which a group of youngsters, young adolescents perhaps, has gathered to engage in some sort of mystic dance ritual in which they make pelvic contact in an odd, sexualized way. Curiously, there are a group of markedly disapproving fully-grown humans that seem to be overseeing the event, as if to discourage and shame the lewd behavior of the pod of pubescents.\nThe female recognizes the glances from the male even from a distance. I can only speculate from here, but she appears to not be dismissing his visual curiosity at all. Simultaneously, she shows no signs of soliciting any further attention nor engage in communication. Across the room, she sees the male, much taller than what we call his \u201cclassmates\u201d, and awkward of movement. Another male, shorter in stature, begins to converse with in what appears to be a pleading, annoyed way. He pushes his gawky friend in the direction of the young woman and she is startled. The tall boy becomes off balance as he is pushed in the direction of the girl that has him so intrigued. They make eye contact in a moment of cinematographic proportions. The opportunity to go back is behind them. \nHe approaches her, tangibly tremoring in front of his prospective mate. She greets him with the standard salutation of man, \u201cHi.\u201d \nAfter stammering slightly, the male begins to communicate verbally, unsure of each word he speaks. They share an uncertain air of familiarity, as if they were enrolled in a human educational course together. In a flash of pure inhibition, the boy blurted out a rushed slur of words suggesting that the two spend recreational time together. She is taken aback. The onslaught of confidence summoned from thin air by the male both impressed and flattered her. Externally, she was baring her teeth in a pleased manner and was giggling involuntarily. He was perspiring above the upper lip. She harshly nodded her head north-south to signify acceptance to the invitation to \u201ca movie and Cold Stone\u201d. His worried nature was abated and he embraced her quickly. She entered her contact information on an artifact known as an \u201ciPhone\u201d that illuminated the dimly lit auditorium. She quickly thrusted his device back into his hands, and scurried away to a group of her female peers, who were giggling as humanoids their age often do. \nWhile the process of young humans innocent way of seduction is uncomfortable for both parties, one can observe that juvenile adulation is a truly memorable and important mark in human lives and their development.", "Crikey, we are out in the outbacks of over populated Los Angeles, when out of nowhere I see a couple of humans hanging around in the corner. There is this 300 pound male with a sinister face who looks like he can kill someone with a single punch, I'm going to go and touch him. As I approach cautiously, first hiding under a vehicle, then crawling through the street narrowly dodging traffic while other vehicles honk at me. Thirty minutes later I managed to get across the street without the subject noticing me. Upon closer inspection I see that the male is using his mating call. \"What up bitch\", he yells to what seems to be a member of the opposite sex. She looks puzzled and looks like she wants to leave but she comes closer. \"Excuse me what did you say?\" she replies. \"I said what's up Bitch\" he said. The lady walks closer and suddenly the man jumps on her and starts what seems to be eating her face. Oh sweet Odin's whiskers this might be a grotesque scene! I'm standing two feet away documenting the whole thing! The behemoth picks up the lady and throws her into the back seat of a cab, knowing I can't miss out, I run and jump on top of the cab. After what seems to be a short ride, we arrive to a small house. The man still enjoying his catch of the day lifts her up and pulls the keys out of his pocket with a single move. They go into the house and I do not know how to enter. I cannot miss this opportunity. I see an opening through the window, and as I approached I could already hear the female screaming oh god, oh god. With no time to lose I threw myself through the window and landed with a couple of bruises and scratches. I seem to be in the bathroom. I exit the door and see a dim light out of a room with a piece of clothing on the floor. I open the door slightly and there they were, screaming like animals as the man pounded her again and again with a cylindrical weapon he carried underneath his belt. The woman was no chump she kept up a good fight and was persistent. After watching for a couple of more minutes I saw that the female had prevailed! The man fell to his side and couldn't get up. The woman sighed, an expression of victory! \"Really?! 300 lbs and only a couple of minutes\". The female had dominated the male and as she got up and started heading towards the door, I realized that I would be caught. I rushed back to the restroom and hid behind the curtains. But she followed and entered. She sat down and excruciating noises were let out. She repeated some of her earlier phrases, oh god. As she got up, I slipped. Crikey, my presence is now known! The female did not hesitate and approached me. This might be my last day, and crap I had shitty McDonald's earlier. She grabbed ahold of my belt and yanked it off. Pulled down my pants and took off my shirt. She was hungry! Then she grabbed my face pushed it upon her face. She proceeded to copulate with me! Two different species, it would not work! After what seemed like an eternity, she screamed thank you and proceeded to chew my head off. Moral of the story stay away from praying human mantis.

I found the button I needed, hidden and rather dusty. Who'd have thought anything a god had would be dusty? Anyway, I found the button and blew off the dust, making sure the label matched the schematic in the manual. I read the manual once more, to be sure, then pressed the button gently.

His voice grew louder and echoed through the house. \"In a thousand years, I'll still be here, and that's all that should matter!\"", "\"Fine,\" Ali said, her temper bursting through. She stepped back into the time machine and cranked the controls. Blue and red lights flashed out the bottom of the machine. \"I'll see you in a thousand years -- and by then you better be more than this!\" She cranked the dial up, and with the sound of crackling static, faded away.", "Still wiping away her tears, Ali stepped out of the vehicle. The house was no longer there; instead it was a barren field of dried grass. The trees and shrubs that skirted the edge of the backyard had all been chopped down.

Though she wore warm clothing that obscured her form, she was easily the most beautiful woman that Farrow had ever seen.", "\"Who ", " you?\" He asked, filled with wonder. Then, regaining some of his composure, he pressed on, \"And how did you get in here? The doors are all locked, no one should have been able to even get inside!\"", "\"Oh, I have ways of getting into places on my own terms.\" The woman said, coyly. \"But I needn't have used them.

But our theories only indicate that forward travel is possible...\" ", "\"Not all things you consider impossibilities are impossible, Farrow. My very presence here should prove that.\" Kalika smiled, and Farrow was disconcerted to notice that her canines were oddly pointed. \"Speaking of which...how is your prototype coming along?\" She gestured to a twisted mass of metal in the corner of the room. It seemed to be made of nothing but rings, a chair, and a control panel rigged together with a few screws.

", "\"I...don't...think...\" Farrow protested, squirming under Kalika's surprisingly strong grip. Deftly, she began punching numbers into the controls faster than Farrow's eyes could follow, and the machine whirred to life at her touch. Farrow let out a cry and began trying to power the device down, but she simply swatted his hand away and continued to work. Just as the first ring began to spin, she withdrew back into the lab, leaving Farrow trapped in a whirling tornado of steel. ", "\"What have you done!?\" Farrow yelled, dismayed. But no matter how much he hammered away at the controls, the machine never responded.

Titus approached the large display and logged the last machine off for the night. The soft blue light quickly dimmed and the humming of the temporal governor ceased at the other end of the room. Titus removed the K.R.O.N.O.S. key and mentally consulted his nightly to-do list one last time before clocking off. As he stood an orange light appeared in his periphery and commanded his attention. It was the soft orange glow of a machine in boot sequence. There were no more arrivals scheduled for the evening, he had checked the log twice. Who turned this machine on?  The machine quickly booted and the blue light announced that it was ready to receive. Titus approached the mouth of the receptical and the blue light changed to green. \"A jump, admin is going to be pissed.\" Titus thought. The machine hummed faster and the green light strobed to indicate a full jump transfer.\nTitus pulled the cover back on the receptical and was surprised to see a young man with his chest heaving and hands grasping out toward Titus. He helped the man out and to the recovery bay reflexively. As he did, the bright orange of the man's shirt told Titus that this would be the only time he'd see this young man. What a shame to waste an apprenticeship at the esteemed K.R.O.N.O.S. institute on an off-the-books jump thought Titus. He skoffed as he dropped the man to the recovery chair.\n\"Who are you?\" Titus demanded flatly. \n\"Phred Cassock\" he replied.\nTitus threw the man a towel. \"Well Phred, you just performed an unlicensed jump, you're lucky this machine decided to boot up when it did.\" The brown curls of the man's hair sprung back into place as he wiped his head down with a heaving effort. \"I've got to report this to admin.\" Titus croaked, his arms crossed. \n\"After what I saw, I don't even care\" the man managed to say as he reclined into the chair. Titus looked over his shoulder. \n\"What'd you see? You know what, it doesn't matter, get the hell out of here and enjoy your last night as a free man.\"\n\"I was right, it was him.\" The man replied as Titus walked to the door ushering his unwelcome guest along. \"I saw him again, common era this time. He didn't recognize me at fist but I recognized him.\" Titus' face was unreadable but he paused. \n\"You've jumped before this?\" \nPhred stared back hesitating. \"I've seen the same man three times now over the course of 7,000 years. It's not a coincidence. His name is Dev.\" \n\"Temporal stalking isn't a thing orange-shirt.\" Titus said opening the peronium security door.\n\"No, not stalking. He wasn't licensed, I've checked.\"\n\"There are no unlicensed jumps, the system doesn't -\"\n\"No, he wasn't a jumper.\" Phred interrupted. \"He was some kind of holy man. A public figure just like last time. But this time he acted different. Callous, jaded.\"\n\"So?\" Titus spat.\n\"He's not a jumper, he's been alive the whole time. How else could he be a historical figure without disrupting the temporal flow?\"\nIt took a moment for this impossible statement to unravel its meaning in Titus' overworked head. \"No\" was all he thought to say.\nPhred continued, \"it seemed the world had beaten the spark out of him but he was happy to see me, I could tell. He's almost figured out the question.\"\nTitus couldn't bear the nonsense any longer. \"Out!\" he yelled as the young man in the orange shirt jumped. \"Your story needs some work before you get picked up by KPD tomorrow.\"\nPhred closed his mouth. He was right. There were more pressing matters than explaining to this glorified security guard that he'd found a way to stop the temporal inevitability. Dev was the key. He needed to jump again.

The heat, the impatience, the low hum of circuitry that surrounded the city of Yorktown in 2764, the year they were paired.", "It had only been about 50 years since her kind had made contact with humans, what was left of them at least. Most had died off from the wars and fallout clouds of the 22nd century. Those that were left saw to it that future generations couldn't react with such insane fury. They had altered their brains to never produce emotions again, in hopes that jealousy, greed, even love would never threaten the human race again.", "Her species took pity on humans and made an effort to rebuild their emotional response abilities in a more organic fashion, as opposed to invasively altering their genetic makeup as their human ancestors had done. Each human was paired off on their 25th birthday with a cal-yen, one of the aliens that that had arrived 50 years prior.", "The cal-yen were immortals who traveled the universe looking for entertainment and sport. They were small beings, no larger than a rabbit, but they were able to withstand the heat and pressure of a star at its core, travel faster than light, and even leap through time. Many of them preferred to travel to the inception of a planet and live through its history before interacting with its denizens, and this time was no different.", "The cal-yen held no personal names, and they generally all shared a similar personality. Tone had anticipated his pair to execute leaps in an organized fashion, starting with the beginning of humankind, and slowly moving forward, but to his surprise, the leaps were determined by him. More specifically, they were determined by small electrical impulses in his brain that hinted at emotional connections.", "When he tried to reason with a moment too much, the device would activate and a bright light would wash over his vision in a flash, followed always by a deep darkness before he would regain his vision in the new time period. It was quite jarring the first few dozen times. In his first 24 hours he had jumped hundreds of times, each jump opening into a more spectacular landscape of color, sound and temperature.", "Each one of the first jumps sent him into a variety of locations, all across the timeline of Earth. But in each jump, she was always right behind him, waiting for his arrival. You see, when a cal-yen gives a time travel device to any being, they can only transport them to places that they have been to before, and Tone's pair had already lived out her time on Earth through all of human existence, just like all the other cal-yen.", "So these locations were just memories of hers that she wanted to share with Tone. The last jump before he had arrived on the coast had been one of the first moments Tone had thought to himself that he may have experienced an emotion. She had brought him to the slums of Chicago on a rainy day in 2047. The screams of a dying opiate user were echoing through the tents and Tone was standing over the corpse of an ancestor of his.", "Tone had just come from the mansion of his ancestor's brother, where piles of food lay outside of the house, rotting in the summer heat, surrounded by a revolting stench. At the time, Tone was unsure if the stench came from the rotting fruit or the skinny man that was crouched over next to the pile, shoveling the filth into his mouth.", "Standing over the corpse, Tone now knew that it was the man he had smelled. It was the smell of bile, old dried urine, wet feces, and an impending death. The fluids leaked from the corpse and melded with the rain that puddled at the entrance of the tent.", "Lightning flashed and thunder clapped as Tone heard an argument coming from outside of the tent. A loud voice yelled,  \u201cBullshit! These were my cans and I'll be damned if some old corpse is going to stop me from collecting!\u201d The voice of a small child could be heard from under the booming voice, \u201cNo, please, my dad didn't leave anything for us, we won't last until the new month. We're already at 2% and he kept stealing our rations\u201d the child wept.", "Tone heard the sound of wet, heavy fists hitting flesh and a man entered the tent, covered in blood. The man couldn't have weighed more than 90 pounds and his facial expression was formed in a way that Tone had begun to recognize as anguish. The man looked straight through him before walking through his body to get to the small pile of canned goods that laid next to his ancestor's corpse. As a time traveler, you can't be seen, heard, or touched by those who are existing in the timeline organically.", "The child burst into the tent in a fit of tears as Tone heard the voice of his pair, \u201cShe will be raped by this man and he will promise her two cans of food, but he will only give her a spoonful of one. This is the moment of conception for the next generation in your ancestry.\u201d", "As Tone stood over the act he remembered the scene in 1974 when another pair of his ancestors created their next generation. They held each other gently, their skin was clean, and they tumbled in clean sheets with their sweat soaking into the fabric. The scene Tone viewed now was filled with dirt and grime, the little girl screamed in pain and the man squeezed her arms so tightly in his attempts to hold her down that her skin began to redden and the dirt on her skin began to smudge under his rain-soaked fingers.", "The little girl's scream was drowned out by a clap of thunder and Tone saw a small stream of red color snake it's way down her frail dirt-covered thighs. Tone's mind wandered, \u201cPerhaps the blood will interfere with the impregnation. But that's impossible since I know that the impregnation was successful.\u201d", "In less than a fraction of a second, the loose thought of logic was drowned out by the flash of light that preceded the deep darkness, signifying another jump. Tone breathed in the coastal air and wiped the ocean's spray, mixed with the rain from his last jump, away from his brow.", "That was the first time that he had tricked the device. He had thought about the question as a way to trigger a jump. His pair summarized the emotion that he may encounter in this year in time, but really he was just glad to be alone, away from any other human.", "A bead of water ran down Tone's cheek and the salt met his lips as he fell to his knees. The oceans were clean in this year, but the taste wasn't like the pacific he was used to. \u201cThis is pain\u201d his pair spoke. \u201cThere are many types, and you will soon experience them all. You will soon be able to categorize and differentiate them all, but for now, just relish in this, your first emotion.\u201d", "This is my first try at any type of creative writing, so please be gentle!! Hope you like it...", "In my final moment, I wish I had left long ago, before I could hurt her so deeply. I think that if I had been less selfish I could have spared her heartache and loneliness. But I did not think to save someone who cannot die.", "Neither of us understood how or what happened, but ever since the lightening struck us I have been out of time, jumping forward randomly.

But each time, she runs to me all the same, and cries her tears of joy.", "I walk the road to our home, and begin to notice that before Mia hears me, she is motionless. She sits in her garden, but does not move. She is like a statue, until she hears me.", "The more I travel, the longer it takes Mia to notice me. The longer it takes her to notice me, the more I notice that she remains still. Until she hears me, she is lifeless. I begin to understand that as she is my whole life, I am hers. While I am traveling forward, she waits. While I travel, she does not live.", "I walk the road to our home, and Mia does not notice me. I kneel beside her and stroke her back. She comes back from wherever she goes when I am not there, and jumps in to my arms crying tears of joy. She tells me she has been waiting for more than 40 years. She's lost count.", "I walk the road to our home, and Mia does not notice me. I go into our home, as quietly as I can. I grab what I need and go back outside to Mia. I kneel beside her and stroke her back. She comes back to me, and jumps into my arms, but I am not strong enough to hold her. We both fall down.

I didn't feel much for her anymore, but I wasn't such a coward as to abandon those hurting right in front of me.", "I stopped trying to leave so quickly after that, but I didn't want to give her false hope that I was a panacea to all of her relationship troubles, and tried to steel my heart. I'd discussed the phenomenon with her extensively, and wanted to take a vacation for once. Go somewhere warm and tropical where she wouldn't summon me for a couple days. She begrudgingly agreed to try solving her own problems for a couple of days. I still wore the utility belt, just in case.", "I wasn't able to fully relax, and looked positively silly wearing nothing but swim trunks and a condensed fanny pack. In the blink of an eye I was standing back in front of her, her face truly terrified. I turned and looked what she was so terrified of, and saw a masked mugger with a gun pointed at her, and therefore at me. I didn't have time to think, time to grab anything. I simply narrowed my eyes grit my teeth, and charged the mugger like the crazy man in swim trunks I was. I should be thankful that he was surprised enough not to shoot me, and he stumbled backwards, not expecting opposition. I tackled him into the snowy ground, cold ice stinging against my bare skin, and threw what punches I could trying to get the gun away from him. Somehow I managed to get a grip on the barrel and tossed it away, though the mugger managed to scramble to his feet and run away.", "I immediately turned and checked on Julia, my red face and dripping nose forgotten, and through her crying eyes I could see an overjoyed smile. She reached up to wrap her hands around my head and pulled me into a kiss. Between the adrenalin of a fight and the ecstasy of victory, I let my testosterone take over and kissed her back. I kissed her like it was the last time I'd ever see her, terrified that I might never again.", "She started to grow more confident afterwards, calling on me less, and crying less  at night. I took her to see a psychiatrist and therapist about her abandonment issues, and even sat in with her in a couple sessions to support her, of my own volition for once! I started to see her smile on her own again, taking up the arts she'd left behind so long ago.", "And in that smile, I realized: I never wanted to leave her again.", "Charles let out a small smirk, glancing at his almost teary eyed opponent. Well he wasn't crying, or even closed to teary eyed, but Charles knew that on the inside, his opponent was in utter shambles. After a grueling 4 hour match, he had finally figured out the move that would lead to his eventual victory, the simple, yet elegant, Qd3. And by the looks of the opponent, he had come to this realization as well. Charles was a few moves away from becoming the Chess World Champion, a goal he had aspired for since his youth. ", "The grin on his face becoming wider, he moved his hands towards the Black Queen piece in front of him. The moment he touched the piece, however, he started to feel the sensation he dreaded oh so much.", "\"Oh, for fucks sake, not now,\" he thought to himself, the panic rising. \"Please, what did I ever do to deserve this. I mean I know torrenting that one Teletubbies Epi-,\" and before his thought was finished, he vanished from the stage, just like that, leaving his opponent, and the audience, bewildered. ", "Moments after he left the stage, he started to materialize in an all too familiar room, surrounded with a bunch of kids and their parents. Everyone gazed in awe, some mouths gaping wide open, as they saw the fully suited up Charles pop into existence, seemingly out of nowhere.", "Little Johnny tugged at his mom's collar, \"Mommy, is that what they call a real magician?\" Naturally, Johnny's mom was too awestruck to respond, her eyes fixated on the rather dashing Charles.", "Charles body started to heat up, and he was blushing wildly, \"Uh, hello everyone. I assure you, this is not what it looks like.\" He started to scan the room quickly, and saw Lana standing in front of the sliding door that lead out. Making his way briskly towards her, brushing past the crowd of startled parents and kids, he gently grabbed her by the shoulder, and took her outside. But not before giving his best fake smile to everyone inside, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, that has been the surprise act for the day, please enjoy the rest of the show. Making a swift motion with his hands, he bowed down, his toupee falling off and falling right into his hands. ", "\"And yet, another part of the act, the disappearing hair act,\" Charles lamented, gritting his teeth together, knowing what he said made absolutely no sense. He heard a few laughs from the parents and kids alike, before shutting the door behind him. While adjusting his toupee, he glared at Lana, who was shifting her feet uncomfortably, staring at the grass surface beneath her newly bought red Nike Shoes, complimenting her freshly dyed Scarlet Red hair.", "\"My God, woman, what is it now? I don't see a single thing that could be possibly be wrong,\" Charles bellowed, his arms flailing wildly, \"Do you realize where I was before this?\" With a loud stomp of his foot, he continued his onslaught of words, \"I was this close,\" his index and thumb finger a hairs width apart, \"This fucking close to winning the World Chess Cham-\" ", "\"I, uh, need help with this new game I'm playing,\" Lana muttered, bringing her iPhone up to Charles' face. ", "\"What.\" ", "\"I can't progress, and I'm really frustrated because this one player keeps kicking my ass.\"", "Charles jaw dropped, and using every last bit of his remaining energy from collapsing, he whispered, \"... The Legend 27?\"", "\"I'll have the buffalo burger--medium rare--please,\" Alan said, before looking over at his date and smiling. She met his eyes and nodded. \"and the same for her. Thank you.\" The waiter collected the menu and left the two alone. Decorations adorned the restaurant he'd chosen for this first date. Lots of pink hearts of all different sizes. ", "\"So,\" she started, \"how was work?\"", "Alan smiled and leaned forward. \"Nothing too exciting, just kept working on that case I told you about. You?\"", "\"Same. Minus that working on a case bit,\" she laughed. Her bright blue pool of eyes threatened to swallow him whole. Alan knew he wouldn't mind that one bit. ", "\"Count yourself lucky, Julie. Sometimes I feel like I'm climbing a mountain of--\"", "A car roared by, speeding down a four lane highway. Alan screamed and stumbled backwards into a median. ", "\"What the fuck!\" he yelled. Ten years and he still hadn't gotten used to this. ", "A familiar face appeared from behind a parked car--Allie's Camry. The emergency lights blinked on and off. \"Sorry,\" she said apologetically, giving him a short smile. The first thing Alan noticed was her short brown hair. She'd finally cut it. Her bronze eyes locked onto his, two windows into the past. ", "\"Allie, I was on a date. She's gotta be's freaked out... I haven't told her about--about ", " yet. Not like they stick around after I tell them,\" his voice dropped into a mumble.", "Allie bit her lip, \"Oh,\" she replied, her eyes dropping. \"Sorry.\"", "Alan sighed. \"It isn't your fault. You're not the one who said something stupid.\" Once the shock drained from his mind he paused to inspect the situation. \"Flat tire?\"", "\"Yep.\"", "With a quick shake of his head he moved to help her. The sooner Allie drove off, the sooner he could return to salvage whatever remained of his date. Alan exhaled to force the frustration away. Allie had already moved the jack underneath the car. No more than twenty minutes would be needed if the two worked together. ", "\"No AAA, huh?\" Allie rolled her eyes and moved to the back of the car. Alan squatted and started raising the car.", "After a moment Allie reappeared with a socket wrench in hand. \"Ever the comedian.\" Alan looked up and grinned.", "A minute later the car rose a few feet off the ground. Alan took the wrench from Allie and began loosening the lug nuts. The silence between the two broke whenever a car zoomed by. ", "Finally Allie spoke, \"What's she like?\"", "\"Who?\" he asked, distracted. ", "\"Your date, you looby.\"", "\"Ah. Julie's nice. She's smart and kind, works as a nurse. I like her.\"", "Despite Alan being unable to see her, she nodded and smiled. \"Good, I'm happy for you. I just hope I didn't mess anything up.\" ", "\"It's all right,\" he replied. \"Really.\"", "The two fell silent again as Alan focused on getting the wheel off. He'd taken off all the lug nuts, carefully handing them to Allie. Losing those damn nuts was the last thing he needed. Alan rose and bent backwards to crack his back. ", "\"You okay? You're doing all the work. I feel bad.\" ", "\"I'm fine,\" he replied, walking over to the trunk. Allie had taken the replacement wheel out already. \"Here, help me with the wheel.\" Alan motioned for Allie to hold it so it wouldn't roll away. A horn blared as Allie walked over. Alan turned and his eyes widened. Mustering all of his strength Alan jumped toward Allie and pushed her away as a white Mustang slammed into the side of her Camry. The car crumpled from the force, falling off the jack. The Mustang bounced off and away before coming to a stop in the middle of the next two lanes.", "\"Oh fuck!\" Allie screamed from the other side of the median. \"Oh fuck, ", ", shit, shit, shit!\" Carefully she climbed back over the median. \"Alan, jeez, you really saved me there. You okay?\" No response came. \"Alan?\" Concern crept into her voice. Voices screeched from a distance. Everything felt numb. Allie couldn't hear herself repeat her question. Her eyes fell upon the point of impact, then followed along the rear toward the median. The car had been pushed forward a few feet, grinding along the concrete barrier. Where was Alan?", "\"Help, someone help!\" a frantic voice called. \"Someone help me!\" Allie shook her woolheadedness away and almost ran forward. Traffic had stopped at this point and those once distant voices sounded much closer. She rounded her broken car, barely noticing the pain in her knee. ", "Her savior lay splayed in front of the Mustang. Blood gushed from beneath Alan's hair and his limbs twisted unnaturally. Something stopped Allie from running to his side. A second later and he disappeared. Allie shuddered and dropped to her knees.", "\"I'm getting really fucking sick of this!\" Mitch shouted at Juniper, working quickly to untie the ropes that held her hands behind her back. ", "\"Yeah, well I wish you never had to show up either. But here we are again.\" Juniper kept an eye on the door to her interrogation room, waiting for the foreign agents to return. ", "After gnawing on a particularly tight section of rope, Mitch spat. \"Can't you get a more relaxing job? Like in an office? I could just show up to help get the printer working or something like that.\"", "\"Mitch, you know this has been my life's ambition.\"", "\"But it isn't MINE. You've dragged me along for this whole ride, working your way towards the top of the heap. I think you LIKE that I was cursed.\"", "Juniper rolled her eyes, but said nothing. Her bonds fell to the ground. As she rubbed her wrists, Mitch crossed his arms and pouted. ", "\"I'm going to get fired, ya know. I can't keep randomly disappearing with no notice.\"", "\"So I'll get you a job in an office with my association.\"", "\"I want nothing to do with you!\"", "The handle of the steel door turned with a clunk. A grating squeal of rusty metal cut through their argument as Juniper's captors swung the door open. ", "As they rushed in to fight, Juniper took them on alone with nothing but the chair, the rope, and her martial arts skills to aid her. ", "Mitch shrieked and cowered in a corner. He never was much help in a fight. ", "Garrett had a love-hate relationship with Kelly.", "\u201cAre you kidding me? I was in the middle of a job interview, Kelly. Do you have any idea how much you are ruining my life?\u201d", "After all this time, he only saw her in her moments of need. That sort of vulnerability can be endearing, even intimate. It is also horribly draining. ", "\u201cKaren just called me. She has breast cancer. With dad gone, I don\u2019t have anyone else to turn to.\u201d She was really trying to hold back tears, but Garrett knew it would be a matter of time.", "\u201cDamn. Ok, I\u2019m sorry, Kelly. Mint chocolate chip in the freezer?\u201d She nodded. \u201cAll right, you grab the Kleenex, I\u2019ll get the bowls. Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d At least now they had a routine.", "The first time it happened after they broke up, he was annoyed. She had a test or something that she hadn\u2019t studied for the next day. He thought it was a cosmic mistake. The second time it happened, he was devastated. The Jaguars were one catch away from the regional championship, and instead of clutching the game-winning ball, he found himself holding her broken arm. This wasn\u2019t a fluke. It was permanent. Some of the guys had never forgiven him. That\u2019s where the hate came from.", "When Kelly\u2019s dad died in that wreck, Garrett was actually glad for the curse. But each ex-boyfriend recovery session made him profane the day he was born. It got easier over time, but also more intrusive, as they drifted apart socially. He still decided to go to college nearby, though, for logistics\u2019 sake.", "\u201cSo how\u2019s her husband and kids taking it?\u201d", "\u201cOh, they\u2019re upbeat about it all, like usual.\u201d Kelly sniffed, then smiled at him. \u201cYou were always like that, too. I don\u2019t know how you would have lived with my mess if you weren\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cBelieve me, there are days I\u2019m not.\u201d He decided it was a good thing she was a fan of mint chocolate chip. If it was peach, this relationship, such as it was, would not work. A smile grazed his lips.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d She leaned forward.", "\u201cI was thinking about how absurd this is, to be honest.\u201d Her frown made it clear that is not what she expected. \u201cI mean, come on, Kelly. You can\u2019t go through life relying on me. One of these days I\u2019ll have a family. They\u2019ll need me more than you do. Are you going to hold my attention hostage then?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\" she yelled, \"You freaking asked for it! Do you think I want to see your face every time? Do you think I want to be reminded that you rejected me? That every man in my life leaves or rejects me? That\u2026\u201d Whatever else she had to say was drowned in sobs.", " Garrett moved over to the couch and laid a comforting hand on her shoulder. She shrugged it off angrily the first time, but not the second. He knew her better than that by now.", "Garrett didn\u2019t really hate her for all of this. Hated the cosmic poltergeist who gave this to him, sure, but not her. He saw her now more truly than he did in those hormonal teenage years. He saw what hurt her. He saw what scarred her. And in his absences, he saw what she endured, and what she pulled through. In a way, Garrett had come to admire her. It wasn\u2019t until he had started realizing that he was regretting the infrequency of her calls that he realized something had changed.", "Garrett was falling for her again. It wasn\u2019t a graceful fall into a woman who swept him away with breathtaking beauty. It was her beauty of small things, of life lived purposefully amidst trial. It was seeing real things about her. True things. Too many girls tried to sell him a fa\u00e7ade. Kelly only met him in her moments of greatest honesty. It was oddly alluring.", "\u201cLook, Kelly, I\u2019m here for you because once upon a time I wanted to be. Truth be told, part of me still wants to be. I just need you to know that being needed, in the absence of any other form of relationship, is horrible for me.\u201d She looked up at him with reddened eyes. She wasn\u2019t that pretty in the moment, but he was sure of it \u2013 she was beautiful. And it had taken ten years for him to realize it.", "He continued, \u201cHow about this? Can we start over? Let\u2019s get to know each other as friends, since we seemed to have skipped that step entirely. And maybe, from there, you\u2019ll be able to figure out who you can truly rely on.\u201d", "She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that. And Garrett, you\u2019ve always been there for me, even when I hated you for it. You\u2019ve always been my best friend.\u201d", "The first time was confusing. Mark, in fact, used the words \"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?\" but as an impartial, polite narrator, I'll use 'confusing'.", "It was a mugging. Lyla was coming home from her first date after the breakup and the dude pointed the knife and \nsaid, \"Give me the purse, bitch.\"", "And Mark, in his underwear, a yellow lipstick of Cheetos around his mouth, materialized in front of them, straight from his living room couch.", "\"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?\" he uttered, as previously mentioned, which was not intended to, but \nhad the effect of, stopping the mugging right away, as the mugger, upon watching a half-naked man materialize \nhimself in front of him out of thin air like popcorn bursting into existence from corn except with a person and \nnothingness (Jesus, what a crappy narrator I am), proceeded to politely say \"Oh, fuck,\" and go home (later, I heard, he checked into an institution and got into New Age music and Paulo Coelho, but that's a story for another day).", "Well, after much debate, Mark and Lyla decided that what had just happened was either collective hallucination or \nundeniable proof that the universe was fundamentally different than humanity had been assuming for thousands of years and all human knowledge had just been rendered obsolete and we'd have to start over from the pre-Socratics on. They figured it didn't really matter, because either way they both had lives to get to and shit to do, and decided to get on with their stuff. They parted ways.", "It was after the third time (the second being another, totally unrelated mugging), when Lyla got trapped in an \nelevator during a power outage and Mark materialized itself once more in front of her, that they figured out that \nthe whole thing was a pattern, and that apparently Mark would show up whenever Lyla was, in his words, \"in some deep shit or whatever.\"", "\"So whenever I'm in trouble, you just\u2026 show up?\"", "\"Apparently.\"", "\"Why!?\"", "\"Gee, Lyla, I don't know, let me check my International Guide to Unexplainable Phenomena.\"", "\"You're being sarcastic, aren't you?\"", "\"No, I really have a guide for unexplainable phenomena.\"", "\"Now you're being sarcastic about being sarcastic, aren't you?\"", "\"I'll add another layer if you keep bothering me.\"", "This continued for something like forty minutes, until the firemen came and rescued them (as, of course, though \nMark had indeed materialized in front of Lyla to be there in her time of need, he lacked the tools to get them out of \na stopped elevator.)", "It started getting suspicious, as far as Mark was concerned, the seventh time Lyla was caught in the middle of a disagreement with drug addicts in the town's worst neighborhood. That's when he started suspecting foul play on her part.", "All the same, he kept to himself, standing by her side as the crackheads robbed her\u2026 then him (because, it turns \nout, crackheads are not as easily spooked by people materializing out of thin air as muggers are\u2026 these guys just \nsaid \"Woah, dude just popped into existence. Let's rob him too!\")", "Then it was a cliff \u2013 literally, Lyla standing on the edge of a cliff, about to lose balance, and Mark popped up by her \nside to save her. ", "Then it was a minor car accident.", "Then a fight with this bitchy girl she knew from high school.", "Mark decided to say something when he suddenly materialized in front of Lyla inside a warehouse filled to the \nceiling with towers and towers of cocaine packs and surrounded by angry, machine-gun wielding Brazilian men somewhere deep in the rainforests of South America.", "\"Okay, that's it,\" he said, as soon as he laid eyes on Lyla, tied to a chair in the back of the room, behind some drug stacks. \"What the hell, Lyla!?\"", "\"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"I got lost hiking.\"", "He got closer to her, untied her, careful not to alert the men patrolling the warehouse just behind the stack of \ncocaine they were pressed against. \"No you didn't.\"", "\"Excuse me!?\"", "\"Look, I'm sorry it didn't work out between us,\" Mark said, as she got up and rubbed her wrists. \"But you gotta \nstop putting yourself into dangerous situations just because you want to try to hurt me.\"", "\"What!?\"", "\"You don't think I've noticed!? Seven muggings! Random fights! Random cliffs! And now you show up at a drug \nwarehouse in South America!? You hate hiking! Come on, Lyla, it's so obvious!

Why else would you keep putting yourself into these dangerous situat \u2013\"", "\"BECAUSE I MISS YOU, YOU IDIOT!\" She pushed him. \"I MISS YOU AND I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CALL YOU \nAND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO SEE YOU FROM TIME TO TIME.\"", "\"Hey, there's a dude with the girl we caught over here!\" One of the drug thugs showed up, pointing the gun.", "\"You miss me?\" Mark asked, quietly.", "\"Yes, you idiot. What, you think I take trips to the rainforest and end up on coke farms by accident?\"", "More men showed up, all wielding machine guns. They pointed.", "\"Fuck, why didn't you just say so?\"", "\"Cause you never seem happy to see me.\"", "\"THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHEN I SEE YOU, NOT BECAUSE I STOPPED LOVING \nYOU!\"", "\"You still love me?\"", "\"OF COURSE I DO, YOU STUPID BITCH!\"", "\"Why are you yelling?\"", "\"BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE!\"", "She looked at the men.

You still in there?\" He asked, poking his head out into the other room. To his surprise, she was looking up at him, cheeks stained with tears. In her hands, she held a small stick made of cheap white plastic, half hidden behind her shaking fingers.", "\"John...I. It's not...\" She stammered. \"I...I can't. I can't leave, not anymore.\" She held the object up, half displaying it to John as if she wasn't sure that she wanted him to see it. \"It's not just about me anymore.\" ", "John swallowed, finally understanding. \"Whose...?\" He asked.

Thank you.\" Margarete said. \"I...I don't know what I'd do, if it weren't for you. Sometimes, I just wish we'd never broken up.

A smile spread across his lips as the sensation rolled over him. A feeling of urgency, a feeling of lightness, of emptiness, of need, filled Hector\u2019s stomach and mind and chest and body. With an open laugh, Hector ran around the restaurant, enjoying his few moments of freedom, of pure, unchained bliss and unrestricted ability, before he was taken away.", "\u201cExcuse me sir, but you can\u2019t \u2026\u201d A waiter scolded, addressing Hector as the man ran around the restaurant.", "Hector didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t notice.

His world turned black, turned silent, turned unfeeling, as Hector felt his body float up into the air, float up into the sky, float up into the emptiness of nonexistence; a lack of existence.", "Just as quickly as it had come, the sensation died down. Hector felt the ground beneath his feet, the air in his lungs, and the breeze on his face. Opening his eyes, Hector looked around him. He was standing on an apartment rooftop, amidst the rising steel, concrete, and glass towers and buildings and monoliths of the city. At the edge of the rooftop, on the precipice of life and death, fall and flight, stood Heather; the woman of Hector\u2019s dreams, or at least, she had used to be.", "Heather\u2019s phone was held in her hand, a wedding ring was sitting upon her finger, and a scowl was sitting upon her lips. She hopped down from the edge of the ledge, and stalked over to Hector, noticing the gleeful look on her old lover\u2019s face, and his fancy dress.", "\u201cAnd what mess have I gotten you out of this time?\u201d Heather growled, facing Hector.", "Hector let out a small laugh, a giggle. \u201cProbably the worst date ever. This crazy girl was talking about killing all of the world\u2019s penguins. You wouldn\u2019t believe \u2026 \u201c", "\u201cYeah whatever Hector.\u201d Heather interrupted, folding her arms in irritation. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep on abusing Aphrodite\u2019s curse, okay? We\u2019re adults now, we can\u2019t keep on playing these stupid little games with each other.\u201d", "\u201cB-but Heather.\u201d Hector replied, a mischievous grin on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be my one and only, forever.\u201d Hector said with mock sincerity, recalling their moment, when they were young lovers, and their confessions to each other. It was on that day, as Hector first conveyed his feelings of love to Heather, that the goddess Aphrodite blessed Heather and Hector to always appear by one\u2019s side in a time of need. That blessing, however, had turned into a curse three weeks later when Heather and Hector had broken up; at the time, the feelings had simply been puppy love, the unknowing of adolescence.", "Heather rolled her eyes. \u201cShut up you jerk.\u201d She said with just a hint of a smile, pushing past Hector.", "Hector watched the first woman he\u2019d ever loved walk past him, towards the door leading to the rooftop. He took a step forward, and raised an arm in the air, his mouth open to speak. Ever since their curse, their blessing, their relationship had endured after all these years. They\u2019d become excellent friends, and despite the bickering, the teasing and joking, they\u2019d become rather close. He\u2019d even been a best man at Heather\u2019s wedding last year.", "A tear trickled down Hector\u2019s cheek, and he dropped his arm. The door slammed closed behind Heather, leaving Hector alone on the rooftop. Despite all the joking, all the goofing and false indifference, he couldn\u2019t ignore it much longer. Hector shook his head, and stared off into the skyline of the city. The wind ripped at his clothes, and ruffled his hair. That puppy love, at least for him, had matured into something more; appreciation, dependence, need. Maybe if he had told her earlier, things would have been different. But he\u2019d been too embarrassed, too nervous about what she\u2019d think after all they\u2019d been through, to break the status quo.", "And now, as Hector stared out across the skyline, and felt empty and lost, just like he always did after seeing Heather wearing her wedding ring, it was too late.", "\u201cSo much for Aphrodite\u2019s blessing.\u201d Hector muttered to himself.", "Hope you enjoyed the story!

Her first car got a flat tire and Eric seemed to come out of nowhere to lend a hand;  she twisted her ankle at the park and Eric was there to help her home.  Eric was always there.  At first, Amelia found it to be endearing, but each time it seemed like Eric had a growing look of resentment in his eyes.", "High School passed and Amelia moved away from the Midwest to fulfill her childhood dreams of attending art school in New York.  Thousands of miles from home and Eric showed up in her hallway when Amelia locked herself out of her Apartment.  Eric was supposed to be back in Kansas City working at his dad's construction firm, but he was here... Eric is always here.  Amelia got mugged and Eric was there; Amelia got in a fight with her boyfriend and Eric was there.

Eric was confused, a deer in the headlights, but he had no ill feelings towards Amelia and helped change out her tire.", "Eric was completing his homework only to be whisked away as if by magic to stand next to Amelia grasping her twisted ankle in the park.  It didn't matter what Eric was in the middle of, he always transported to Amelia when she was in need.  Any good faith Eric felt towards Amelia quickly turned into disdain as Eric realized that Amelia was a curse.", "High school finished and Eric was ecstatic to learn that Amelia was going off to the East Coast.  He had a job lined up with his father and he could be rid of Amelia once and for all - freedom; he could drive a car without being transported away; he could go on dates without disappearing.  It was with significant shock and hatred when he opened his eyes to find himself outside of Amelia's New York apartment watching Amelia dig through her purse.  The curse was still there.", "It's been 10 years of the Amelia curse; 10 years of misery.  Kansas City, New York, San Francisco.

She warned me that living with the favor of a God/Goddess would be difficult. I should have listened. ", "Meeting girls has always been easy for me. People said I was just charming. I know better now. I met Sita when I was 15. There was something about her that just ignited a fire in me. As always I was able to catch her attention with just a short conversation. It wasn't long before the whole school knew we were dating. She was so beautiful.  Long raven hair, bright green eyes that actually sparkled when she was happy. A smile that could brighten a room instantly and she always smelled so good. I knew from the moment we spoke that I was in love. Thinking back on it now, what did I know of love? I was a kid. A dumb idealistic brat in love with the Idea, of being in love. ", "I remember that day after the homecoming dance. We were walking hand in hand. We stopped under the bleachers by the football field. She kissed me and I told her I loved her. She said she loved me too. I told her, \"No matter what, I'll always be there for you. I swear on our love\"\nShe broke up with me 3 weeks later. No explanation,  no apology.  Just, \"this isn't working. Find someone else\"\nI was as heartbroken as a kid could be. After a while I swore I'd never say those words to a girlfriend again unless I was sure she loved me too. I got rid of all her pictures and little gifts. I never wanted to see her again, but the God's take oaths seriously. ", "I saw her again, for the first time 2 years later. I was driving home in the muscle car my parents got me for my birthday. It needed a lot of work but I was excited to have wheels. I saw her hunched over in the rain and cold by the bus stop. She had a large bag next to her. Too big to be for school. I pulled over. I got out and sat next to her, she barely looked up at me. \"Hey\" was all she said.\n\"Hey\" I replied. \"Need a ride?\" I asked.\n\"That yours?\" She asked. \"Yeah, birthday gift\" I responded.\nShe nodded. \"You have awesome parents.\" She whispered. She looked up at me. \"Im leaving town. I have an aunt that lives 3 hours away. If your serious about the ride, will you take me?\" She asked. \nI thought about it for a moment. I'd just gotten the car and had never been out of town on my own before. Still the way she looked at me, her eyes pleading and full of sorrow. I couldn't say no. \"Sure, hop in. Ill get your bag.\"\nIt didnt occur to me to ask why she was leaving or where her parents were. It just felt right to help. I got home at 4am. I was grounded for 2 months and my car was taken from me. She had smiled that beautiful smile when in had dropped her off. It was worth it. ", "I met her again when I was a junior in college. I was invited to a frat party for the first time ever and almost didnt go. I felt I would miss out if I didnt though. College is about the experiences, so im told. At first I wasnt sure it was her, it had been so long, but when she smiled I knew. I wanted to talk to her and for a moment our eyes met. She was swooped up by a good looking guy in a football jersey before I could reach her. I spent the rest of the party bored. It was when I went searching for a bathroom that I found her again. I was told the bathroom was down the hall but I kept getting turned around. She came rushing out of a room I had passed twice. Her clothes were a mess and her lip was bleeding. She saw me and grabbed my arm. The guy I had seen her with came out of the room a few moments later. He stopped when he saw me. \n\"Hey\" she said. \"I havent seen you in forever, walk me to my car?\" She asked.\nI stood there glaring at the guy in the jersey. \"Sure, no problem\" I finally reply. She didnt let go of me until we reached her car. Once again I earned a smile as she drove away. I walked back to my dorm thinking that one day, that smile would be the death of me. ", "So on it went, I loved and lost and loved again. I would love my life and years would pass before seeing her again. Each moment we met was when she needed me most. Sometimes it was for small things, like a ride, other times it was more serious. I was there for her, just like I swore I would be. I stopped being surprised after a while. I lived my life with the assurance that I would see her again and earn another smile. I became successful in my career, had everything I'd ever wanted and more. Still, I would go out into the world each day, looking for her face amongst the crowd. Waiting for the moment when she would need me again. ", "Now that final moment has arrived. That moment I knew would come. When that smile would be the death of me.", "This story,  is for you Sita. So you would understand why I did what I did. You see, I met your husband. He's a good man. I realize now why I hadn't seen you in so long, after meeting him. He showed me pictures of you and your kids. They're as beautiful as their mother. All with that same gorgeous smile. Dont worry, I didn't tell him I knew you. He came to ask me for something. Something apparently only I can give. ", "My cancer is inoperable. I have been given only weeks to live. Caught it too late they said. The doctor told me because of my condition and my rare blood type,  I would be doing the hospital and several people in it, a great service and sacrifice,  if I would donate my organs. I hadn't made my decision until today. When your husband showed me your picture,  I knew. This is the last time I can be there for you. What I give to you hasn't been mine for a long time. Its been yours ever since I swore that oath, so many years ago. I give you my heart, to care for and keep safe.", "My oath is kept, I have no regrets. Who am I to question the Gods?

Sandra and her current boyfriend, Rumio, were the town\u2019s local supply of dope, and less than lethal party drugs; like acid, shrooms, and ecstasy. It was a small town with a poor, small market, and not really many dealers to go to. Even though Sandra and Rumio kept a \u201ccode\u201d to never sell any amount of or any type of drug that they knew would kill a particular person, they never made a code to never skimp their customers.", "\u201cWhat, do you need a loan or some shit? Or are you just horny and your boyfriend isn\u2019t around again?\u201d Shane was rather pissed at this point. A day hadn\u2019t gone by that Aphrodite\u2019s curse hadn\u2019t played it\u2019s merciless joke on him. It had been calming down recently, and he figured he might be able to start having a normal life again. Shane was supposed to be at the premiere of a big blockbuster hit, \u201cThe Comedical Advancements of Hubris the Flying Baby\u201d, but in the middle of the previews was sucked back into the grip of Sandra\u2019s hurricane of a life.", "\u201cNo, I need somebody that can hold a gun.\u201d Sandra handed over a .22.", "\u201cWhat the fuck is this peashooter gonna do?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s gonna scare off these jocks we fucked with.\u201d Sandra and Rumio had taken it upon themselves to not only sell a football player a bag of chopped up romaine, but hadn\u2019t even given him the proper gram to dollar ratio. Sandra and Rumio had sold oregano to this kid before, so they figured he would probably still be too stupid to tell the difference. But Kenneth, the fool, had smoked lettuce in his youth after hearing talk through his bedroom door of \u201csmoking the devil\u2019s lettuce.\u201d", "\u201cAnd why should I give a fuck that you pissed some jocks off?\u201d", "\u201cBecause even if you leave, you\u2019re just gonna come back when they actually show up.\u201d They of course being the entire football team; small town sports teams are essentially packs of hyenas.", "\u201cSo why don\u2019t I go get a real weapon, like a chainsaw?

We don\u2019t need heat all over our shit, man.\u201d Sandra shoved the .22 into Shane\u2019s chest. She stormed off into another room to grab her phone and her baton. While she called Rumio, Shane looked out the window.", "\u201cYou got any idea what type of car these kids might roll up in?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know, probably some busted up piece of shit. Pretty sure Ken\u2019s dad own a Thunderbird.\u201d Rumio picked up, Sandra asked, \u201cHey, where are you, babe?\u201d", "\u201cPulling up right now.\u201d Just then a green Thunderbird swerved right into his driveway. Rumio parked quickly, reached for his bat in the back seat, and got out. Five kids exited the Thunderbird, all looking around before a couple charged towards Rumio. Sandra and Shane came leaping off the front porch towards Rumio, trying to distract a couple of the linebackers. Rumio managed to break a kneecap on of the kids, but took an uppercut from his backup. Rumio tried shoving the kid away via tip of bat. It hurt the player\u2019s chest, but he grabbed the bat and swung it to the side.", "Sandra wasn\u2019t strong, but people didn\u2019t think a baton swing to the ribs wasn\u2019t gonna hurt.

The first shelf of the cabinet was full of plates and bowls. The second shelf was for glasses, and there may have been a little space. She packed the glasses more closely, eliminating empty space between glasses, effectively transferring it all to one spot. She tried to place her new mug, even pushed, and was rewarded with the sound of ceramic on glass, and glass on glass objects rubbing against each other. She shuddered, felt a rise of annoyance, but quickly calmed herself and sighed. She'd had years of practice of shutting down negative emotions that would lead to a wish that her problem would just magically disappear.", "No worries, there would be somewhere else. She opened up the next cabinet over, but it was full of tupperware and baking dishes. She opened the cabinet under the sink, where the pots and pans were. It could go here. Alone. A solo mug among pots and pans. That was too ridiculous though. You couldn't stick one mug with all the pots and pans. Or could you? No one had to know. She imagined her mother coming over and opening the cabinet, seeing the single mug, and staring at her with a look of....she realized that this was not the right solution. ", "She went back over to the cabinet and looked at the top shelf. It was completely empty, but always just a bit out of reach, even though she was a little taller than average. The answer really was pretty simple. She put a knee up on the counter, grabbed the 2nd shelf of the cabinet and awkwardly pulled herself up. She reached up with her other hand to place the mug and was accosted with a vision of herself falling, which she shrugged off, but was quickly followed up with the question of how she was going to get the mug back down when she wanted it, this really wasn't the best solution. She realized she was getting worked up again, and lost her concentration enough that her hand that was stabilizing her by gripping the shelf lost its hold. She lurched her body forward to correct, but then her knee slipped and gravity did the rest.

It was pretty comical to be honest.\" ", "\"You didn't use to be such a dick,\" she muttered as she sat up. ", "\"Come on,\" he said as he grabbed her hand and gently, but firmly helped her to her feet. He led her around the island to the couch and sat her back down, and then went back to the kitchen without a word. Her jaw was at a 6 now, and the ringing had mostly stopped. She heard sweeping in the kitchen. ", "Five minutes later he wandered back in with neosporin. He uncapped it. ", "\"No, I can do that,\" she said.

She was not happy about either.", "Steve tried to make some small talk while he swapped out the spare, but Sandra was being cold as usual and Kendrick was keeping Damien occupied.

Steve was standing there awkwardly looking like he had just been slapped and Sandra was looking like she wanted to slap him. \"Thanks Steve.\" It was not spoken warmly.", "He just smiled and closed his eyes.

She began shuffling on the pavement, an embarrassed attempt to end the encounter as quickly as possible. \"Sorry. About all of this.\" Waving her hand to encompass everything, Lindsey began backing away. \"Sorry,\" she repeated, then turned and quickly strode up the sidewalk, into a stream of pedestrians and out of Craig's sight.", "Craig stood stewing in his misfortune. There was no point in calling after her, no point in asking for her help. It was not her part to be a helper, it was his. The little miracles that ensured Lindsey would always have what was needed never applied to Craig.

As constructive as possible, anyway, given his circumstances. He went over his emergency plan, the one carefully developed over the years of his sudden appearances to answer Lindsey's need. He knew what to do, just resented having to do it.", "Grinding his teeth, Craig did his best to concentrate on getting home. The anger was difficult to push away, the unfairness of it all bubbling up.

Instead I wondered what the side effects of swallowing too much toothpaste were.

I found reading books was the best activity to indulge in, as I don't think a falling book has ever killed anyone. Every time I transported, my girlfriend learned something new about me (Though I thought it seemed rather unfair since every time I transported, I was midway through an activity, and without the context of said activity, I wound up looking like a psychopath. Transporting to her family dinner soaking wet and naked sure does kill the mood) but the more she learned about me, the more disinterested she seemed, and after three weeks of being transported to her side, she dumped me. Much to our surprise, for the first day at least, I would leave her and walk out the door, only to immediately be transported back to her side. That first day was pretty awkward.", "By the third week, I learned that I have a sailor's mouth.

Anyway, I ended up finding some translated version of a book of rituals from this ancient cult of Aphrodite.

A flat tire in the middle of nowhere. She wouldn't speak to me, though. Nothing beyond a polite, \"Thanks.\" ", "A year had passed since she last needed me. I had almost been able to stop thinking about her when she started texting me. I ignored them, every one of them. I couldn't handle it again, the possibility that she finally felt the same way that I did, followed by the crushing realization that she never would.  ", "Today was the day. The day that all of my sadness, my loneliness, would end. I opened the door to Joy's building. I walked past the elevator and climbed the stairs. I had time. I couldn't help but think of Steph, even as I approached the door to my date's apartment. At number 513, I raised my hand to knock on the door, and thought of her again. I stopped. I couldn't do this. Not to myself, and not to Joy. She didn't deserve it. I went back to the stairs and stopped. I looked down, towards the exit, but I turned upwards.  ", "I took my phone out of my pocket. I texted to Joy, \"Sorry to cancel on such short notice, but I'm not feeling well.\" As I reached the top of the stairs, I opened the door to the roof. A warm breeze touched my face as I held up my hand to shield my eyes from the sun. I had only a sneaking suspicion of why I was up there.  ", "I paced around the roof. What would my life be like from this point onward? Would I ever be happy? Could I? No, certainly not. Joy, who I'd met through a mutual friend, was everything I could ever want but for the fact that she wasn't Steph. Steph, though, didn't want me. I'd never be happy. Every time I thought I could be happy had turned out to be a lie.  ", "I knew, now, why I was here. It was the only answer. The only way to relieve the emptiness. The sadness. Erase it. A part of my mind screamed for me to stop, but I knew that was emotion and not logic speaking. I had already realized the truth. The truth carried me with slow steps onto the ledge. The truth spread my arms, and closed my eyes.  ", "Even in my last moments, I heard her voice in my head, \"Tom? Tom what the fuck! What did you do?\"  ", "I opened my eyes and saw her there, falling with me.

While she was evidently saddened by the event, I had no knowledge of this, and was instead doing some homecleaning, dancing in my underwear to my Queen playlist; Tie your mother down, to be exact; poor choice of song for the situation.", "The amount of eye contact with everyone; strangers, her parents and brother included, amounted to what almost equated as a firing squad. Considering her immediate family was made aware of my....\"situation\" with Lucy, it never did make it any less awkward. ", "Regardless, there I am, near-buck naked in a funeral procession; neurons firing double time to think of an explanation, reasoning, humourous joke, anything to break the ice. Then again, it wasn't my fault.\nTurning to Lucy, coolly as the day I tarnished my birthday suit, I proclaimed \"Really? ANOTHER booty call now?\" slyly smirking. A few chuckles and \"spit your drink\" chortles were heard, so I perceived this as a success. She just gave me the death glare, excused us from the room, and dragged me out of sight into the next room.

Which reminds me.....\" ", "As I said this, I not-so subtly leaned in to her face and sniffed. My assumption was correct, exclaiming a rather large sigh.", "\"You were drinking, weren't you?\", Her gaze shifting to the floor left of me, like a child stealing a cookie.\n\"...No......\" She stuttered. \n\"I don't blame you, but I should be the last thing in your mind, especially now.\", stating the obvious misconnection, but she just shrugged it away. there was nothing she could do. ", "The air became tangible at this point, as the conversation became silent and awkward; She didn't know what to do, and given his mishap of this \"gift\", she knew I was stuck here, two thousand miles from home as it wasn't the first time. This was the least of my concern, however.", "\"So I don't suppose there's a spare suit? not everyone showed up in white....\". I had to break the silence somehow. There was a dead person in the other room, hundreds of other strangers questioning the situation. Forget being laughed at, I'm pretty sure her uncle Pete from Texas is here, and he's a big fan of formal occasions, just as an excuse to bring his shotgun. She scoffed at my petty attempt. \"Wait Here.\" she said, and went back into the room, leaving me here like a lost shaven puppy for quite some time.", "It felt like an eternity before she came back. I was expecting some sort of literal monkey suit. Instead, she came back with a pair of stained slacks, an inverted KILLERS T-shirt and a red tie. A feeble attempt at best, but she's trying.", "\"You know....you don't have to go now...\" she subtly informed me, drifiting the question off as though it was a cheesy line from a porno.\n\"Yeah, because everyone isn't going to question why a chubby guy in underwear popped into existence at nana's funeral. it's bad enough as it is......wait, no cufflinks?\".

She had every right to want to end things \u2013 his disappearances, while random were a constant sore spot between them. What was he up to? Why couldn\u2019t he talk about it? And why did it always happen when his ex was having trouble in her relationship? It drove Sebastian to frustration each time. Even now, he struggled to maintain his composure. Why the fuck did it have to happen to him? ", "It was a fucking curse. It had to be. When Sebastian was 15, he had promised his then girlfriend Lucy that he would always be there for her if she needed him which she reciprocated. It was a stupid promise, but then it felt right. They were young and in love in the only way that young lovers could be, promising each other the world. But it didn\u2019t last, it never could at that age. But somehow, someone had heard them and noted.  ", "The first time it happened was when he was 21. They had both long since moved on, Sebastian to a string of casual lovers and Lucy to her first serious boyfriend. They had apparently been dating for two years when Lucy was contacted by a stranger. Apparently her boyfriend had broken up with her out of the blue via text, leaving Lucy heartbroken. He had been cooking dinner at the time when there was a flash and suddenly he was standing before Lucy who was laying on her bed crying. He had held her hand all night then slipped out in the morning when she finally feel asleep and walked two hours to get back home. ", "He thought it was weird but considered it a one off, some bizarre phenomenon. But it happened again, almost two years later, this time to him. He had been going through a rough time, getting strung alone by a girl who he thought felt the same about him. When he finally worked up the nerve to confront her about it she laughed him off then disappeared the next day. After half a bottle of scotch he finally broke down, tears erupting from eyes like a fountain. Yet before they had managed to reach his chin she was there, bringing him into her arms and whispering sympathy in his ear. She was gone by morning too, a ghost from a past he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be a part of. From there it went downhill, the occurrences happening more and more frequently, appearing in front of the other during moments of sadness or need.  ", "It took a toll on the both of them, each time a highly charged emotional moment where the other was a sudden intruder. Almost a year ago Lucy had enough. She started screaming when he appeared; that her grief was her own and not for him, and if he could just please leave her alone. He had left the house in a black cloud; it wasn\u2019t his choice, he didn\u2019t want this, this burden. He had heard later that she had moved across the States to LA, as if somehow the distance could prevent the occurrences from happening.  ", "And for a while he thought it did. He met Amy and felt the pull that finally, he had met someone he could love. The visitations to Lucy no longer happened and he let his guard down. For almost three years, he felt like he was free. But little over a month ago, it started happening again. One moment he was jogging with his dog then flash and he\u2019s suddenly standing in front of Lucy in the middle of what looked like her living room. She was teary-eyed and upon meeting his eyes only shook her head and looked out the window. Wrapping her arms around herself, she said she was ok. She was married now, and just had an argument with her husband so if Sebastian could please leave before he got back. He practically ran out of the house, catching a taxi to the nearest airport. He managed to get back home two days later. Amy was frantic, but he pleaded a work emergency and she let it go. ", "But the curse couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t let go. Within the next two months he was back there at least once every two weeks. Each time it was the same but as time went on, he started to notice differences. She would be more wary, her eyes more pained each time. Then the bruises started appearing; minor ones at first but when one appeared on the left side of her face he knew. He pleaded with her, begged her to get some help. When he finally left it seemed like she might actually do it. ", "But when Sebastian got home, he found Amy waiting in his apartment. She demanded to know where he had been \u2013 they were supposed to have dinner together. She called him at work and when they didn\u2019t know where he was she called him on his phone at least a dozen times. He tried his best to calm her down but she was hysterical. Was he cheating on her? Was he unhappy? A lump appeared in Sebastian\u2019s throat; he fought to hold back tears. How could he explain what was happening to him? He showed her the ticket, explained Lucy\u2019s situation \u2013 how her husband was beating her, how he had been flying up there to try to get her to leave him. He had totally forgot to call but no he wasn\u2019t still interested in her, they were just kids when they dated. She didn\u2019t totally believe him, but she could feel his sincerity. When her tone changed, all he could feel was relief. Relief and gratitude. His promise was out of his lips before the question had even formed in hers. ", "And that night, he prayed to whatever god was out there, that this was the final time.", "Sebastian was in the bathroom when it happened; he had gone for two weeks without incident and Amy was finally starting to forgive him. It made him ecstatic that she was starting to trust him again and he felt like celebrating. Dinner had gone well and he was washing his hands when white light suddenly blinded him. He found himself outside of Lucy\u2019s house facing a slightly ajar front door. He panicked right away; he had taken to leaving his phone in plain view to show he wasn\u2019t hiding anything. Now it sat on the table, along with Amy waiting for him to return from the bathroom. A wave of despair hit him and he bleakly wondered how he was going to explain this to Amy. When he glanced at Lucy\u2019s front door wondering why he would appear on the street, he noticed the door frame was cracked.", "He came through the broken front door in a stiff walk and found Lucy on her knees in the living room, a handful of her hair in his husband\u2019s fist. The husband was shouting at her, his voice raised in fury along with his other hand. Sebastian didn\u2019t even hear what he was saying as the last three months coalesced into that moment. All the frustration and anger flooded his mind like a tidal wave and snapped his willpower like a twig. Sebastian grabbed the husband by his raised arm and spun him around. Looking surprised, Sebastian obliged him by knocking him clean over with a punch to the face. Releasing Lucy\u2019s hair the husband when down, blood pouring from his nose. What happened next was a blur \u2013 he remembered watching himself like he was a stranger standing in the room. He climbed on top of the husband and began raining blows down on him, screaming why could the husband just leave Lucy alone, why could he keep his fists to himself, and why did he fucking have to always drag Sebastian into this. ", "At this point, Lucy hauled him off, Sebastian still spitting curses and profanities at the barely conscious figure on the ground. Lucy dragged him outside and calmed him down. Yes, she was ok; yes she would call the police. ", "A cab ride later and the rage was gone. It was midnight at the airport and he tried for the tenth time to call Amy\u2019s cellphone from a payphone in the waiting area. When she finally picked up, he almost broke down. He started stammering, simultaneously thanking, pleading and begging but she silenced him with a single word. She spoke calmly but it was obvious that she had been crying. It was over. ", "When she hung up, the tears he had been struggling to hold back finally came to life. Turning around, he found Lucy, her face slightly swollen with tears and bruises as he knew she would be. She looked tired and scared, but she took one look at his face and without a word stepped forward and embraced him. Tears started streaming down his cheek as he hugged her back. At least this was something that they both knew would never change.   ", "Note: on mobile so keeping short and sweet. Sorry for lack of format.

I had been walking for an hour straight now and I wasn't even halfway back to my job. It probably would've been faster to head to Nate's and have him give me a ride back but the thought of having to make up an excuse for my complicated situation, yet again, exhausted me. I was emotionally drained, just like every other time and it only seemed to be getting more frequent. It was getting to the point where I couldn't even go a few days without having to be in this situation yet again.\nI didn't have any idea how far I had walked. You would think after ten years of this, I would've gotten used to it. Not. \nIn High School, I had been some lanky kid desperate for any girl to give me a chance. Sitting down, I thought back to those days, when I had scoured the internet for tips and tricks to get the girl. A humorless smile formed on my lips as  I pictured my younger self sitting in his room performing a prayer ritual to Aphrodite, the Goddess of love. I had promised to be by the side of any girl that gave me the time of day whenever she was in need forever and always. Had I known what was to come, I would've never committed to a lifetime of this. The smile slowly disappeared from my face at that thought. \nAmber came into my life that very next day. She was radiant. There was a light in her that I had never seen in anyone else. When she spoke to me the very first time I thought I was surely dreaming. Her wide, light brown eyes were full of mischief. Her thick golden brown curls gleamed brightly in the sunlight. Her personality was brilliant and fierce and gentle and passionate. I had never seen the world, not really, until I met her. The thing about being a kid, is that everything that you feel is more intense than it will ever be at any other point in your life. She was a destructive storm and I was a storm chaser that was swept away by the force of her. It wasn't long before I fell head over heels for her and finally built up the courage to ask her to be my girlfriend. In my fifteen years of life, I had never felt as happy as I felt during that time that we spent together but I would be insane to say that I hadn't noticed the sadness that lay behind it all. With that passion and whirlwind of emotions, came an endless well of darkness that was slowly extinguishing the light that I had come to know. \nOnly months later she had asked me to a park where we had met many times. It was there that she had explained that she couldn't keep it up anymore. The entire time she had refused to look me in the eye as she confessed that she had cheated on me. That day I learned that with every immense high there is a seemingly endless low. We stopped talking for a while. It hadn't been hard to avoid her since we hardly had any classes together, at first anyway. I could only keep that up for so long though. I felt myself drawn to her despite the burning anger and pain that being by her side brought me. After some time the hurt of her betrayal faded but she was spiraling and that caused a different hurt altogether. I did everything in my power to comfort her. I wanted to. Doing that fulfilled something inside of me that I hadn't even realized forming. It morphed and changed within me until it was an instinct. Borderline obsession even. It wasn't until years later when I would link my incessant need to be at her side every time she needed someone to the night that I had begged Aphrodite for a chance at the love I had always craved. \nEventually, heading to her house on impulse became dropping everything in a moments notice at her call. That evolved into racing to her side no matter how far she was from me. The stranger things started only a year or two ago. The first time it happened, I was sure that I had completely lost my ever loving mind. I had been in the middle of helping a friend move and in the time it took me to blink, I was in Amber's one bedroom apartment. \nA vibrating in my chest pulled me from the memories of everything that had happened in the past ten years. It was soft at first, barely there. It always was but then it grew into an increasingly louder hum. I closed my eyes, the familiar feeling of weightlessness taking over me. I didn't dare look, it had yielded unsavory results the one time I had tried. The process took an instant but it felt like it lasted at least five minutes. The familiar smell of lavender filled my nostrils signalling that I had been transported back into Amber's apartment. I was standing in her bedroom this time. It was a mess like it had been when I had been here earlier that day. There were stains on the carpet that were probably months old, some were maybe even years old. My instincts led me into the small bathroom that was connected to the bedroom. The door was ajar and the light was on indicating that Amber was in there. When I entered, my eyes found Amber's small form curled up between the sink and the bathtub. Her eyes were closed and the only sound in the room besides my shoes crunching the broken glass on the floor, was her ragged breathe coming in soft wisps. There were pill bottles lying all over the floor empty. I moved slowly over to where she was and slid to the ground, leaning back against the wall across from her. She stirred and her eyes fluttered open. Her thick eyelashes framed her almond-shaped eyes in a way that I had always admired but there were dark circles under them from nights that she had spent battling her inner demons while I held her. ", "\"Jake..\" Her full lips formed a weak smile. ", "I didn't speak, just stared at her. I was afraid that if I did, I would lose the last shred of sanity I had left for tonight. In this moment, I felt older than I was. At twenty-five I should be thinking about the family that I would be starting but this broken girl in front of me had consumed my every waking moment for a decade now. There had been times when I had hated her for it but had known deep down that I could never truly hate her. Some small part of me would always love her. It was the depression she had struggled with all her life that  I truly hated. Despite my advice and offers, she had decided repress it with drugs and sex than with actual medical help. She had in a way sealed our fates. \nHer arms trembled as she tried to prop herself up which is when I noticed the open wounds on her wrists. I slid my way across the floor so that I was closer to where she was now. ", "\"I'm so sorry, Jake. I just can't do it anymore.\" She sounded tired. The light in her eyes had dimmed to almost nothing now as she searched mine for something. ", "\"I know, Amber. I love you.\" I said back softly. ", "She seemed satisfied and leaned back, closing her eyes once more. Her breathing continued to slow as time wore on. For the first time in a long time, I felt a calmness sweep through me unlike any I had ever felt before. I almost didn't recognize it when it happened. Amber had lost a lot of blood today and even though I was no doctor, I knew that the lack of blood mixed with all of the pills she was sure to have downed just before I got here were going to be too much this time. It was almost as if I could feel it within myself. I don't know how long it took for her breathing to stop but the instant it did, I could feel my heart start to slow. It didn't hurt like I thought it would but the prospect of what came after was still mildly terrifying, especially with how long it was taking. As my chest clenched with the finality of my last handful of breaths, my eyes landed on her. She would be the last thing I saw and even though I had never really believed in anything after death, I knew that wherever she went I was going to follow. Even now, pale and fragile, she was as beautiful as she had ever been and I knew that my last words to her had been absolutely true.

The walk rarely bothered me.  There was the occasional early (and I do mean early) morning or times when it was an annoyance to be pulled from my current task but it was only five or so blocks, one of which was through a park.  There had been opportunities to move even closer, but nowhere good for the kids.  That, and I don\u2019t want to be any closer than I absolutely have to be.", "The smell of burning organic matter hit me as soon as I\u2019d opened the front door.  I entered the kitchen and managed to stifle a giggle as I discovered my wife leaning over a pot on the stove with a spoon raised to her lips, face pursed in disgust.  She noticed me and dropped the spoon into the pot, replacing the lid and brandishing the tea towel, with which she had held the lid, over her shoulder.", "\u201cNo!

I placed my hands on her cheeks and squeezed until her lips were smooshed together and lightly shook her head while giving her the crazy eyes.", "\u201cI fucking love you so.  Damn.  Much.  You know that?\u201d", "\u201cAwiite, awright, jesus big guy\u2026 No need to get all silence of the lambs,\u201d she teased as she fought my hands away.

The progression was accelerating. I stood up.", "Next thing I know I'm standing in a dirty bathroom.

I'm stuck again...\" Her voice trailing off meekly. ", "I tried to just walk out the door but every time I did I simply stepped back into the bathroom.", "\"You still keep the KY in the same place?\" I sighed as I opened the bathroom drawer knowing the answer. ", "Later I tried to call Jennifer but she wouldn't answer. This is the fourth potential relationship she's ruined. I know she's doing it on purpose, but she denies it.", " John thought to himself as he looked over his meeting slides one more time. Glancing up at the clock told him he still had about five minutes left. Today was the \"big day\", the day he presented the results of his six month project to his company's Executive Board for review. His work, his funding and quite possibly his future at this job rested on this meeting and he hadn't slept in three days between preparation, nervousness and, well... the other thing. ", "Just thinking about it drained the color from his cheeks. He quickly glanced around to ensure he knew where he was. After all, with the blink of an eye, he could-", " He had been holding it in for the past couple of minutes, hoping he could wait until after the meeting. But now... Nature was calling. Insistently. There was a bathroom just off to his right, so he placed his documents on his seat, motioned so that his partner Michael knew here he was going and strolled over. ", "As he stepped through the threshold, though, he gaped in horror. He wasn't in a bathroom. He was in an emergency room. It had happened again.", " he thought, his thoughts racing as he whipped his head left and right. He was in the waiting area, having just walked out of the bathroom door on this side. There were sick people coughing, sneezing, napping or just resting in chairs on the far end of the room and just before him was a desk and two nurses in seats behind it. He rushed forward, both of them focusing on him from whatever conversation he had clearly interrupted.", "\"Yeah, hi,\" he started, already wondering how he could get back. He knew how it worked. He was here to do something and he needed to do it and with his meeting looming, he needed to do it fast. \"I'm looking for a Rachel Thompson? She told me she'd be here, is everything okay? Is she okay?\"", "The nurse to his left turned to his computer and started typing. The one on his right turned away as well, but to pick up a phone and started talking in medical jargon that John didn't bother trying to translate. After a moment, the computer-nurse looked up.", "\"Ms. Thompson is in room 118 and it looks like she's doing okay,\" he said, his Texan accent reminding John how far he had traveled from Connecticut with this jump. \"However, the Doctor's notes state her boyfriend is the one that brought her in. Can I ask who you are, sir?\"", "There was something about how the nurse spoke that made John nervous. Not for himself, he knew there was nothing anyone could blame him for. Hell, he hadn't been in the same state as Rachel five minutes ago.", "\"I'm her-\" ", " \"-friend. We went to high school together. Look, you said her boyfriend is with her? Do you mind if I just check on them? You can even escort me back there if you have to, I just want to make sure she's okay.\" ", "The nurse glanced at his co-worker, who was still on the phone. Shrugging, he got to his feet and leaned over the desk, pointing off to John's right at a pair of double doors.", "\"If you go through those two doors, all the way down the hall and make a left, it'll be the fourth room on your right. There's another desk at the end of the hall if you can't find it. Someone should be manning it and you can ask there. Try to be quick, though, okay? I'll buzz you in.\"", "John nodded his thanks and turned for the door. As he approached, he barely heard the buzzing of the lock coming undone and he pushed through the doors. The other side was your standard hospital hallway. Linoleum floors and doors every few feet where you could see inside and either see empty rooms or curtains drawn for privacy. Stretchers and wheelchairs and medical rolling trays lined the walls between the doorways and the entire place smelled very \"clean\". There was a buzz of noise in the area, from beeping medical devices to the talking and footsteps of people rushing back and forth, trying to keep ahead of the workflow. John reached the end of the hallway and turned. He could see from here that the fourth door was the only one with the light on and kept walking. As he got close, though, he could hear voices.", "\"-bet the police are coming, AGAIN,\" said a man's voice with a tone of irritation and a similar Texan accent to the nurse. \"Jees, Rachel, I can't believe you did this again. I swear, I don't know why I put up with this nonsense.\"", "John stopped in his tracks. That had to be Andy, the boyfriend. The last two times he had jumped states, Andy had given John a bad vibe. He seemed nice enough and smiled when he spoke, but there was something about how close he stood to Rachel... Something about Andy didn't feel right to John. \n\"I-I'm sorry, Andy,\" she stuttered. \"I promise, honey, this is the last time. Don't be mad, okay?\"", "A sudden jingling of small metallic items, probably doctor's tools being pushed around a tray made John jump.", "\"Don't tell me not to be mad, Rachel!\" Andy snapped. \"I shouldn't have to put up with-\"", "John took the last few steps to the door and knocked solidly on the frame, leaning around it to peer in. He forced a smile to his lips and tried his best to look innocent.", "\"Hey, guys,\" he said, attracting the attention from both Andy and Rachel. Andy was in his usual jeans and a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up. The tattoos on his arms were clearly visible, but what caught his attention was Rachel's face. She was sitting on the hospital bed with a medical gown on. Her hair had changed colors from John's last jump and was now brown with some light highlights in it, like how she had colored her hair when they were first dating back in high school. It would have made her look pretty if not for the swelling black eye and scrapes along her face and neck. \"Jees, Rachel, what happened to you?\"", "John couldn't ignore that Rachel's eyes flashed to Andy before replying.", "\"I, uh, I fell,\" she said, shrugging as she spoke. \"You know me, John, super clumsy.\"", "John knew. He knew exactly what had happened, just from that lie. Rachel had never been clumsy in her life. During high school, she had been a dancer and walked more gracefully than anyone he had ever known. His eyes shifted to Andy, who he realized was staring a hole through him. He felt his right hand ball into a fist and saw Andy's eyes catch the motion.", "\"What are you even doing here, John? How did you know we were here?\" he asked, slowly turning his body to face John. Through gritting teeth, John responded.", "\"Hospital called me. Rachel must have forgotten to change her emergency contact. Hey Andy, want to grab a coffee with me real fast?\" Andy's eyes narrowed even more, but he gave a quick nod in response. Glancing at Rachel, he squeezed her shoulder as he stepped away and John couldn't help but noticed her flinch.", " John started, but couldn't finish his thought from the pounding in his temples. He felt his blood rushing faster and faster, his temperature rising. As Andy got close, John moved in a flash to grab him by the shirt and twisted, dragging the man around with him and shoving him out the door. Andy stumbled into the hallway and landed with his back against the opposite wall. Instantly, John was pushing his forearm against Andy's throat, cutting off his air supply. He leaned his face close and spoke through a clenched jaw.", "\"Listen to me, dirtbag, if you ever, and I mean ", " come near Rachel again, I swear to God, I will know, I will be there and I will personally end you. ", "\" Andy's eyes shot left and right. People had heard the noise of the two men and were coming out of rooms and around the desk from the corner John had passed to get to Rachel's room. Behind him, John could hear Rachel sobbing softly and the sound only made it harder to keep himself from putting Andy's teeth down his own throat with some assistance from his fist. ", "Realizing that no one was coming to his aid, Andy looked back at John, his eyes wide. He nodded his head, wheezing for breath and John released him from the wall. Turning his back on the man, he walked into Rachel's room, softly closing the door. She looked up at him, tears streaming from her eyes.", "\"I am so sorry, John,\" she started. He walked over to the bed and sat on the edge, slipping his hand into hers. He felt the cuts and bruises on her fingers. She had tried to defend herself. \"I swear, I never wanted to pull you away. I tried so hard to keep calm, I thought that if I didn't freak out, you wouldn't come and-\"", "\"Shhh, it's okay Rachel,\" John said quietly. He was reminded how beautiful her eyes were. The sky blue color had always been his favorite part of looking at Rachel. \"I'm glad I came. Really, I would have wanted to be here if I didn't jump.\"", "Rachel let out a sob and leaned forward, her head against John's chest. His free hand gently stroked her hair as he continued to quietly hush her. After a few seconds, he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket and pulled it out without moving her. It was from Michael, his partner back in Connecticut.", "John smiled. He had wanted to be the one to represent his work after all this time, but he realized he had been at the right place at the right time. A soft chuckle made Rachel look up at him and then, realizing he had his phone out, she frowned.", "\"Is everything okay? Did this keep you from something important?\" she asked.", "Again, John looked her in the eye as he responded.", "\"Don't worry, Rachel. I'm exactly where I needed to be. Everything is going to be fine, just like I promised you. I'm right here for you.\""], "SUBREDDIT": "WritingPrompts", "SCORE": 18841, "TOTAL": 972, "TYPE": 1}

I awoke first- from the glory of god shining down into the dirty room. The light bouncing off of empty bottles and onto not only my face, but also Mary's glistening snatch. Note that this was before me and my bro had met the holiest of all bro's, the son of party: Sleazus Christ. I tried to wake Chad for a sneaky escape, but in his drunken stupor he thought my shaking of him was someone attempting to draw graven images on his face, and so awoke loudly and violently, and with great swearing at your bro. In my own stupor his flashing of fists aroused my own anger, and so it came to pass that there was a great catching of hands by both parties; stirring our sultry host. Her babeliness giggled at our anger, and called to us for a truce and a return to a bonding of flesh. So here it was that the son of God came to see his on the low girlfriend for a romantic morning together, only to discover her with two dicks in her mouth, shouting a muffled \"hey baby!\", her teeth irritating the flesh of your dearest bro. Jesus sighed, removing his tunic \"Alright bro's hurry up in there, it must be my turn soon.\" Too which chad replied, \"Yo dog theres plenty of room in the back\" so it came to pass that the holy foursome was consecrated with leftover wine and non-homoerotic touching of balls. When all were satisfied, His Broliness, pulled a joint from Mary's hair, saying \"This is my grass, lay with it, and feel the glory of god shine upon you.\" Thus the Big Sleazy pulled a joint from Mary's hair for each of us and we lay in the sun. After an hour, none of our joints needed ashing, none of us were hungover, and all of us were right on the cusp of being too high, and yet were still functioning. It was in this moment that Chad and i decided we would dedicate all of our parties to this man, the chillest bro to ever chill. \"We wanna party with you for eternity bro!\" I exclaimed, chad followed \" Yeah man; aint no party like a JC party cause a JC party don't stop!\" There following a slapping of hands and a shredding of air guitars. Big Sleazy, thusly being satisfied by our performance, and sheer display of overall broliness brought us into the crew, where me and chad would one day share in sainthood as the holy bros of party.", "The Gospels According to Brad:", "After their dissent in Damascus, Chad and Brad were sent to Adath, in the lands of the Samaritans.  Paul bade them to shoulder the greatest challenge of any of the disciples, and to bring the word of The Lord to those that openly mocked the followers of Christ.  Chad insisted that it was actually a punishment and humiliation for their behaviour at the Last Supper, that it was really a slight.  But Chad doesn't know shit.", "When they came to Adath, the sun was low on the horizon and the two disciples were weary from their long voyage.  Chad had forgotten to water both their camels at the last oasis, only giving his own camel the Lord's gift of water in the desert.  So the disciples arrived sand-blown and tired, ridding double-hump on one camel.", "The land of Samar was in the middle of a harvest festival, and Adath was filled with merrymakers.  Just as their Lord before them, Brad and Chad were unable to find any room in the inns.  Brad knew it was a sign from the Lord, blessing their mission.  He looked for a manger, that they may follow in their God's footsteps.  However, the closest thing to a manger was a chicken coop that an incredulous stall vendor agreed to let them for the night, provided his chickens could bed with them.  But not in the Biblical sense.  Because that is wrong.  We did hash that over before, but to avoid anyone saying that's only Old Testament stuff, we're gonna mention it again:  Don't fuck chickens.  Or cloven-hoof animals.  Or the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, or the lizards that walk the sand.  Any animal really.  The only think you're allowed to bang is humans.  Preferably in a heterosexual monogamous union ordained and approved by the local church authority.  Subject to all applicable fees and taxes.  Sex toys might be okay, but they also might fall under the category of masturbation.  Because of ongoing litigation between Durex and the church, our attorney has asked us not to comment on the matter.", "Anyways, There Chad and Brad laid their heads, among the chickens.  Chad was a real buzzkill about the whole ordeal, but it was clearly a sign the Lord had good things planned for the two devotees.  When morning came, the two emerged, feather-spattered and unrested, but ready to do Paul's bidding.  They set up shop right near the chicken coup, near a bustling fountain, to begin their sermon.  Chad was totally oblivious to how convenient their accommodations right in the market were.", "While the villagers drew their morning buckets, Chad and Brad stood next to the trickling water and told the pagans the Word of the Lord.  Some of them looked to the noble figures, silhouetted by the rising sun.  However, most of them paid no heed.  Their eyes were sunken and red.  They shuffled as though the weight of the Devil was upon them.  After a few hours, Chad finally asked an old woman why no one was paying attention to them.", "The bent crone told them they were in the middle of the Winter Festival.  The revelry had lasted late into the night and the villagefolk were feeling the after effects of the wine that was customary at the festival.  Undaunted, Chad and Brad continued their preaching.", "At noon, across the fountain, emerged a local holy man.  He wore no shirt, just pants in the style of MC of Hammers.  His long dreadlocks were beaded with bright ornaments that twinkled when he nodded his head with great enthusiasm, which he did often.  The crowd cheered when he took his place opposite Chad and Brad.  A fervent follower threw him a hand harp from the masses and the he began to strum it while a circle of drummers dropped him a beat.  He began to sing in a style unknown to Chad and Brad.  It went thus:", "Woke up quick at about noon", "Just knew that I had to be proselytizin' soon", "I gotta get drunk before the day begins", "Before Demeter's pain really sets in", "About to go and that gin got me near blind", "--At this point he gestured rudely at Chad and Brad--", "Young niggaz was here, throwing up Christ signs", "So I ran to my bros and I grabbed my harp", "I got the beat here and side to side.", "The crowd even sang along in perfect stereo to 'side to side.'  If there was one thing that Chad and Brad could agree on, it was that the devil's hand had been at work that day.  The  priest's demonic chanting continued for some time.  His words were not from any song they had heard before.  And it hinted at pagan prophecy, because he sang about Chad and Brad, though no songs had ever been composed about them before.  Likely, they will sing of Chad and Brad in the future, but they hadn't at that point.  Yet the man's lyrics called them out by name.  The warlock conjured up facts about them, some of them eerily accurate, like Chad's celibacy, and Brad's mother's past as a destitute prostitute in the streets of Jerusalem.", "It got quite graphic.", "Chad and Brad both tried their best to summon words from thin air as the warlock did.  They asked the Lord above, in the name of their saviour, to grant them this gift of rhythmic song conjuring.  The Lord's blessing was not with them.  They attempted to draw attention to the man's strange manner of hair.  But the crowd jeered at their attempts and lauded the Warlock's 'sick dreads.'", "Despite his almost-complete musical undergrad, Chad wasn't able to muster anything near the power of the Demonic Warlock.  He parleyed with an off-beat and stuttering insult at the likelihood that the Demonic Warlock was inflicted with venereal disease because of the numerous sexual encounters he boasted of.  And that that was a mighty blow on him from the Lord Above.", "That's when the rocks started flying.", "It began as a light barrage of handfuls of sand and pebbles.  But Chad had to go and make one last comment about the local honey mead and it quickly escalated to a bombardment.  Some of the missiles lobbed were as big as two fists held together.  And like a big guy's fists.  And Samaritans have really good throwing arms.  It isn't that important of a detail, but Chad insisted that it be included in these gospels since we flipped a coin to see who had to write about this part, and he said he just wasn't going to mention any of this in his book.", "So it was, that as the sun dipped low on the horizon, the two champions of God's word were chased by a throng of mindless zombies conjured up by the Mouth of Satan who had manifested himself as a dreadlocked Demon Warlock with music and mind-control powers.", "In the chaos that ensued, they couldn't find their camel and were chased from the city on bare feet.  Alone in the cold desert, the two disciples ran until they were pretty sure they couldn't see any torches or pitchforks in the distance.  They both agreed they were at an all-time low.  Clearly, the Lord was testing them.  Without fuel to make a fire, Chad and Brad laid with each-other in a shallow cave.   NOT in the Biblical sense.  Though it might be cool if people do that.  We're still not totally sure.  Also, pending litigation, we can't state our...  yadda yadda yadda.", "The smaller spoon, Chad, asked over his shoulder, as the cold wind blew in, if they were going to be okay?  Or if they might perish of exposure in alarmingly fast dropping temperatures.  Brad thought sagely and whispered in his brother's ear: It is clear the Lord is testing us, and we must simply stay the course.  Besides, they had done as the other disciples had asked.  They had made the long journey, found accommodation, and preached the Word of God.  Sure, there were some snags, but God was clearly just following the three act structure.  They had arrived victorious, been defeated by Satan Himself Incarnate, but, for real, what mortals could hope to stand up to Satan Himself Incarnate?  The had fought hard, but been bested.  Now that the second act was over, it was their turn to win.", "That seemed to calm Chad enough, because he answered only with quiet snores.  Under the icy moonlight, in dangerously cooling temperatures, the two disciples slept, spoon to spoon, safe in the knowledge that the worst was behind them, and that God would send them a mentor who would teach them awesome powers.  Then they could fight Satan in a 2v1.  Though, that would still be unfair.  Brad's thoughts became more and more muddled and he decided to stop writing about their day and get some sleep too.  But, for real, it's getting really cold.  There's frost on the sand dunes and everything.", "Thankfully, they did wake in the morning.  However, it appeared the second act wasn't totally over, because Chad lost three fingers to frostbite.  Two from one hand, three from the other, and Brad had to cut them off to prevent gangrene.  It was really gross and Chad still hasn't said thank you.  Even though he had been delirious and resisted so hard that Brad had to knock him unconscious and tie him down before he could perform the life-saving surgery.", "To be continued in The Gospels According to Brad, Chapter Two: The First Legit Rap Battle In History.

It was known among the followers of Jesus that his father was the best among all growers, so it was with great haste that the apostles gathered round him. 2.Once all had taken their places, Jesus held his joint aloft, for all to see. \"Fetch me a light,\" he declared; and it was done. 3.Jesus did take the first drag, christening the joint with his christly lips. \"Into this doobie I have rolled the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.\" He then did pass to the right. 4.The apostle Peter did accept and toke of this blessed joint, passing it on to his brother Andrew, who passed it on to James. From James it passed to John, and from John to Phillip. Phillip passed it to Bartholomew, who passed it to the apostle Chad. 5.It was now that the hazy silence was broken. Chad did toke of the Holy Spirit, though his face revealed his confusion. 6.And he did ask Jesus, \"J, how can that be? How can we be smoking the Son, when you are sitting right in front of me, bro?\" 7.Chad did pass the joint to the apostle Brad, who carried on; \"Ya bro, like, there is no way you could ever fit inside of a joint. I mean, you're a grown man. And especially after all that P90X we've been repping. You're looking swol, JC, am I right, boys?\" 8.The other apostles let out a WHOOP WHOOP; Brad did indeed receive an amen. 9.All, that is, except for Judas Iscariot, seated to the left of Jesus. He rubbed his own brow with thumb and forefinger for a moment, before glaring at the apostles Brad and Chad. 10.\"You fools!\" He declared, \"The Holy Spirit is not him physically! He is a man, made holy by his spirit, which comes from the Lord, his father!\" 11.Chad was taken aback. \"So my spirit comes from my father?\" Brad did question further, \"Maybe that's why your mom always says you haven't got any!\" 12.The apostle Brad did expose his knuckles to the apostle Thomas, and the knuckles of the hands of the two apostles did touch. 13.Brad the  turned to Jesus, \"JC, sick doobie, bro, but it's running a bit. Just let me-\" 14.Judas did cut him off. \"Pass the goddamn joint already! The Lord is your father! Your spirit comes from him!\" 15.Brad, now, was taken aback. \"The Lord is not my father, bro! Ephithius is my father. Ephithius Johnson. I look just like him and everything. And besides, my mom ain't like that, bro.\" 16.It was now that the apostle Chad appeared to have received a revelation from the Lord. \"So, like, if my spirit is holy then can I roll and smoke myself, too? J, you're gonna have to show me how to do that, bro! That is some next level shit!\" 17.Brad did struggle with demons. \"Maybe she is like that. I mean, I don't know. I mean, she did leave the house at night a lot. And Ephithius was never really around until I was like 13.\" 18.It was at this time that the joint did reach Judas; it was but little more than a roach. Judas did throw up his hands and exclaimed, \"Jesus Christ! Well, that's just great!\" He did stand, and like a departing storm he did depart from the room. 19.Bartholemew did call after him, \"Judas, thou art a cunt!\" at which Judas did raise his middle finger, not looking back. 20.\"J, bro, totally not your fault. That was super uncool of Judas. You rolled an awesome J, J, bro,\" the apostle Chad did console. Brad helped, \"Ya, bro. Wicked J. Stellar performance bro.\"", "It was said of Chad and Brad that these two were Jesus' favorite apostles, whereas the others tended to moon over his brilliance, those two could see the son that yearned to be free of his father's dogma. Yet despite their best efforts, Jesus was never able to escape his calling.

When Jesus saw his friends he greeted them and promptly took a cup to show his appreciation for the gift. When everybody saw the wine they immediately heralded it as a miracle from Jesus. Brad and Chad were getting the stink eye from security and had no choice but to go along with it. That was strike one.", "Strike two was a beautiful Sunday, the Sabbath,  Chad and Brad thought it unwise to waste such a gorgeous day doing nothing so they brought Jesus to the beach to catch some waves. Their mistake however was giving Jesus a blue surfboard. Mixed in with the blue of the ocean the people once again thought they were seeing a miracle as it appeared that Jesus was walking on water. It was a very hot day so we can't judge them too much...", "The last straw came after Jesus' death. Chad and Brad were devastated and when their friend was subsequently entombed, they thought it would be a great homage to the man they knew if they were to replicate one of his all-time favorite movies \"Weekend at Bernie's\".

In a recent find, biblical scholars have found a much older version of the book (circa 62 CE) that has caused quite a controversy.

", "That's the feeling I got when I caught a glimpse of the flag the first time. ", "There I am, one of 3 people on an entire planet, scouting for physical evidence of ancient river beds. We'd been here for 4 Earth days at this point, so I was used to the un-exciting terrain. Rocks and dust everywhere. Red and black and brown, endlessly in all directions. I had come around a small rocky hill, scanning this horizon, when there it was to my left, a flag-pole. ", "I think I did a double-take. Half \"that's a flag-pole\", half \"THAT'S A FLAG POLE.\" I stopped dead in my tracks and re-evaluated my position. I was on Mars. There were 3 of us. Nobody had ever, ever, ever been here before. None of my crew-members had been out this way. But yet... that was distinctly a flag pole. As I approached it, the wind kicked up and revealed the tattered remains of a cold war era Soviet flag... had to be at least 100 years old. My mind was still trying to wrap itself around why this was here, and my body was telling me to run. My hands felt sweaty and my breathing was heavy.  At the base of the flag was a black cube, about a foot each dimension. It had handprints set into two sides. ", "My curiosity got the better of me. At this point, I really should have radioed into my team to tell them what I had found. I should have marked the location on my nav-map, and retreated, to be explored later. I shouldn't have touched the box. But I did. I placed my hands where the outlines were on each side, and as I did, my head exploded. ", "It was like a shot of light stabbing me in the eyes. A searing pain gripping my entire body. Unholy screams tearing through my ears. Unable to breath, unable to move, it felt like I was being compressed into a marble and torn into a billion pieces at the same time. The event lasted for what seemed like a lifetime, and then... it just stopped. I was left with an understanding. Knowledge. Somehow, the cube had implanted a lesson in me, instantaneously. I knew why the Soviet flag was here. I knew why the Russians had never claimed any great accomplishment on Mars. I knew why the cube was here. It was a warning, a last ditch effort by humanity of old to save us from ourselves. I knew it all to be true. ", "The solar system had been seeded with life by a passing comet several billion years ago. Earth, Mars, and a third planet between Mars and Jupiter, understood as \"Utopia\" in the transfer. Similar life forms evolved on each of the planets, but Humanity had evolved on Utopia within the last several hundred thousand years. Over time, humanity had reached the point of being able to visit the other two worlds, and had begun to establish small colonies for research. ", "Over time, Mars would become more heavily populated. Earth was the sore thumb of the trio, with the least favourable environment, and was therefore left to the scientists to poke and prod at, never a plan for full colonization. Mars became a second arm of the human civilization, growing larger and attaining it's own identity. Political strife created a rift between Mars and Utopia, and eventually, war. War that would last 1,000 years. War that was so engrained into the minds of the Martians and the Utopians, that they did not know another existence. War that was taken to such extremes, that when the Utopians began the irreversible process of syphoning Mars' atmosphere, the Martians blew up Utopia. I could feel the pain of billions of lives lost, as though I was there to witness the events unfold. ", "The remnants of humanity that were able to escape Mars left for Earth, and left behind the cubes as a reminder of what once was, and a warning that there were no more second chances. Earth is all there is left. ", "The history books will tell you that America won the Cold War. But I now understood the truth... the Soviets had won, and they had won by silently backing down for the good of humanity. There would be no second chance, we were already living it. ", "The door was built into the side of a cliff, but about a foot of Martian dust had accumulated in front of the step. A red square was emblazoned on the front, with the yellow image of a hammer and sickle right in the center.

The Russians had steadfastly denied that they\u2019d made it to Mars, much less that they\u2019d established some sort of colony. But who else could it have been? Who else had a secretive space program?", "The hatch was locked, of course. \u201cShould we knock?\u201d Rodriguez joked. Commander Davis gave the door a hearty pound, but no one answered. Their drill, originally built to excavate soil samples, wasn\u2019t exactly equipped to cut through solid steel. Instead, they bore holes through the red rocks around the hinges until it crumbled apart and the door came crashing down. The airlock was dark and silent. ", "Davis and the crew entered the facility. The winding hallway descended deep under the mountain. They passed by room after room, full of bunk beds for sleeping and a large cafeteria with neatly stacked trays. Some of them held computers larger than the rover they\u2019d driven over here. There was an entire floor of greenhouses, now just full of withered stalks and brown soil. ", "\u201cWhat do you think happened here?\u201d Hatfield asked, shining his flashlight on a teddy bear that had been abandoned in the hallway.", "Finally, the expedition found the colony's inhabitants in some sort of large gathering space, like an auditorium. The door was sealed from the outside, with no escape. Through a thick window covered in scratch marks, Commander Davis could see decaying bodies in red jump suits. Some were holding others in one last embrace. Others were apparently trying to escape through some sort of vent, with little luck.

But it was open. There was a single body at the desk with a pistol in hand and a hole through the forehead. Also on the desk were a stack of journals, each marked with dates ranging from 1963 to 2002.", "\u201cDay 1,\u201d Norvolisk read aloud. \u201cThe Soviet Republic of Mars is hereby established with the purpose of keeping the People\u2019s Revolution alive even in the event of catastrophic war on Earth.

So where the hell did the cosmonauts go? Why did they keep all this secret even years after the cold war?\" It was decided that they would not alert the Russians of the fact that they had discovered their presence on Mars. Naturally, they announced to the world their mission to put a man on Mars but the Russia government never said a word. After all, a world is a big place to hide.", "\"That is what we are here to find out, the vehicle isn't the only thing our rover found here.\" Their Captain walked about 20 yards from the vehicle then began to stomp the ground.

It had multiple screens, all running the current events of what was happening back on earth. Some of which were news but others were views from cameras that merely showed street corners and mundane activities.", "\"Please provide authentication code.\" The computer stated once again. There wasn't any change in the way the computer sounded but Aldo almost imagined he heard a slightly impatient tone.", "\"What are you-\" Aldo was cut off as the trap door swung closed, red lights began to blink and a siren wailed. Johannes ran to the door and tried to open. \"It's sealed captain!\" She shouted with heavy breaths as she pounded against it.", "\"ERROR.\" The computer responded in a booming voice. \"ERROR, authentication not provided.

The bodies though...", "They weren't wearing any clothing, but scraps of what looked like old suits clung to their flesh. They were not in good shape. There were massive growths over most of their skin and something else...", "\"They look like they are all connected to each other. Like there is some kind of, I don't know, umbilical cord connecting each one to the other.\" Jenkins said. \"Carmichael, we have to find a way to report this.\" ", "The buzzing was a little louder now.", "Our Earth-range radio had stopped working shortly after we had established the small forward base. We couldn't find anything technically wrong with the equipment, but Jenkins had managed to trace some kind of signal coming from this cave. We had come out here to investigate, not knowing what we were going to find. ", "The cave was shallow and we didn't see any technology.", "\"Can you sweep for the signal? Try to find where it's coming from? I don't see any machines. And what the hell is that noise?\"", "This buzzing was starting to become irritating.", "Jenkins held up his small receiver and swung his arm slowly from one rocky wall to the other. Then he hesitated. I could see, even through the tinted facemask, that something was wrong.", "\"What?\" I asked.", "\"Hold on. This...oh shit.\" He said, bringing the receiver to rest in front of the Russian cosmonauts bodies.", "I swallowed. \"It's coming from them, isn't it?\"", "I don't know what Jenkins said in response, because suddenly the buzz became much louder. It was all I could hear. I cut the speaker in my helmet. It didn't matter, I still heard it.", "Suddenly, Jenkins doubled over, and a long line of the red Martian dust that covered the floor exploded upwards between the nearest cosmonaut and him. His suit split open in a line from his boot to above his knee. A pulsing tendril of flesh, exactly like the ones that connected the Russians to each other, now connected him to them.

Pain is a burden we will reject together. Until then, we will all be quiet, and wait.", "We'd seen it in the distance, an anomaly on an already alien planet.

Red and copper, with silver glinting through the dust. His own breathing was the only thing he could hear, the burst of static from the radio dimming into the distance as he looked at the flag. A wire ran through it, keeping it upright. Due to the exposure, it had been bleached almost white, but it was still unmistakeable. The pale shape of a hammer and sickle on a background that had once been bright red. ", "Luke moistened his lips and reached out to touch it. A Soviet flag, and he was too young to have seen the Space Race of the 60s, but this would have been shouted from the mountains. Where were the bases? Even in the dying days of the Cold War it had never been mentioned. Luke scanned the landscape, wondering if he would see some clues as to why the flag stood there, but there was nothing. The sand lay in settled ridges around it. Dust, as far as Luke could see. ", " ", "In the box he carried, the rocks were beginning to weigh him down. Samples, for the small team in the Rover. Him, Tori the All-American girl, and Parker, the foul-mouthed Australian who was bitter about working with Americans. Already he was past the time he'd expected to be out for. Massive over-provision of supplies allowed for delays, but he couldn't stay out here indefinitely.

Taking photos now.\" ", "He raised the camera and pressed the button, allowing a stream of images to be taken and sent instantly back to the Rover. He imagined Parker swearing under his breath at having to come and join Tori at the screens, checking the display, the flag stood square against the drab landscape. His throat was surprisingly dry. Luke coughed. Spit wouldn't form in his mouth. ", "In his ear, Tori replied. Her voice had a twinge in it that Luke didn't recognise. The usually chirpy voice was gone: underlaid was a current of fear. ", "\"Greenman, this is Woods,\" she started. \"Is something affecting your connection? We're only hearing gibberish.\" ", "\"This is Greenman, what do you mean, gibberish?\" ", "\"You're not making any sense,\" Tori's voice rose to a crescendo. \"Are you okay? The photos--\" ", "She'd abandoned protocol. Luke frowned. His lips were chapped. When he moved, the dryness split and blood began to run over his chin. He extended his tongue, but the droplet ran faster and he could no longer reach it. ", "\"Damnit,\" he growled. With gloves and the cask, he'd have to wait until he returned to clean his face. The flag stood resolutely still. In his ear, white noise whispered. He sniffed, feeling blood begin to leak out of one nostril. Frustrated, Luke turned and headed for the Rover, still feeling some elation at bounding across the rocky ground. Day on Mars, the sky was a pale blue, greyer than on Earth. The blood from his nose became a torrent, leaking and dripping over his lips. He could taste the iron of it, and tears leaked from his eyes. ", "The Rover stood stoically flat over the next series of mounds. Orange dust swept up to it, covering every inch of its bulky frame. The thick windows glinted silver. ", "\"This is Greenman,\" he said as he approached. The rocks seemed to be becoming heavier. Pressing him into the ground. Luke ran a hand under the strap of the box. It was then he noticed the blood on his hands as well, leaking through the gloves. It stemmed from around his fingernails, though he felt no pain. ", "There was no answer from the Rover. ", "\"This is Greenman,\" he said again. ", "\"We can't open,\" Tori's frightened voice came back. \"We see you outside Luke, we can't let you in.\" ", "Something broke and fell in Luke's mouth. He spat it out; a rush of blood and saliva. A tooth sat against the screen of his cask, down to the root. Some of the gum had come out, too, and it glistened in front of him. Terror twisted within him. ", "\"They're in the air, Luke,\" Tori said again. \"They're in the air, we can see them in the photos, and now they're inside you.\" ", "The liquid that trickled from his eyes wasn't tears. Luke's heart began to pound, fear eating in his belly.

It's scary. It's... unlike anything else.", "And yet, as I stood and looked across an expanse of nothing but reddish brown sand and dust, I felt absolutely nothing but disappointment. The voyage was hell, and I'd spent ", " looking forward to landing that the reality of Mars just couldn't live up to what I'd been expecting. The first three days were mind-numbingly boring and dreary.", "The fourth day changed everything.", "\"What... the ", " is that?\" I asked through the comm system, pointing at a torn-up tent in the distance. \"Did one of you assholes set that up to screw with me?\"", "\"I wish I were that creative, believe me,\" Stan responded, staring alongside me. \"But that... that's not us. There's a flag, Mike. I can't make it out from here.\"", "The two of us, along with Victor Foreman, our engineer, pressed forward with caution. As we approached, the flag became increasingly visible: plain red, with a yellow hammer and sickle. It was tattered and coated in dust.", "\"Okay, this is bullshit. O'Neill, are you fucking with us?

You see this, right?\"", "\"Already contacting Houston. Someone's going to have to reach out and see if there's something we don't know about. Does he look injured?\"", "I kept myself at a distance, scanning his body with my eyes. There were still packets of food on a nearby counter. \"No. Honestly, it looks like he just suffocated. He didn't starve, and there's no blood or any kind of wound.\"", "There was a large, clunky device on the table in front of the body.

This last one will be in English.", "\"Russia has abandoned me. I was sent here as an experiment for the government, to see if we could set up a base, maybe build in secrecy.

I repeat do you copy?\"", "\"Yeah, yeah, I'm here, keep your panties on, Tex.\"  Commander Tripp Jackson said as he fiddled with the radio controls on his wrist computer. \"What do you want?\"", "\"I'm getting some strange readings coming from the northeast.  Possibly from that crater up over that ridge, ya' might want to steer clear.\"", "Jackson scoffed, \"Tex, this is an exploration mission, checking out weird readings is kind of what we're here for.\"  He looked to the rest of his crew behind him.  Lieutenant Rickles, his science officer, was crouched beside her sample digger ever engrossed in its readouts, while Lieutenant Kraskov stood beside her.  Kraskov, even though he was wearing a spacesuit and was the sixth man on Mars, still somehow managed to look bored.", "Jackson shuffled towards them, the gravity on mars still took some getting used to, his feet kicking up plumes of orange-red dust.  He keyed his local mics.  \"Hey guys, Mickelson is chewing my ear off about some strange readings just over that ridge,\" He said while pointing, \"I say we go check 'em out.\"", "Rickles glanced down at her wrist and then back to the readout on the digging machine, which rumbled and spat out dust as its auger bored into the Martian crust.  \"Just about done here Commander.  Our itinerary is clear for the next 45 minutes; Mission Control likes to give us some time to 'enjoy the sights.'\"", "Jackson chuckled lightly to himself, that woman was only concerened with her experiments.  He himself was interested in the concentration of things like nitrogen in the soil, or how the Martian gravity effected certain things, but she was obsessed.  It was her job though, and she did it well.", "\"About time,\" Kraskov grunted, as he shuffled away from Rickles' experiment and towards the ridge, \"Too much science, not enough exploring.\"", "Jackson waited as Rickles' finished tapping away on the digger's output screen.  She confirmed that the information had transferred to her wrist computer and stood.  Stretching out her legs she glanced over at Jackson.  He gestured towards the ridge, where Kraskov had already started lumbering up, and they both began their way towards it.", "\"What kind of readings?\"  Rickles asked.", "\"Mickleson didn't-\" Jackson began before being interrupted.", "\"I'm gettin' strange readings on a lot of my intstruments.  From spikes of power on nearby sensors, centering on that area, to bursts of gravity change.\" Mickelson said in his southern drawl.", "\"You're saying there's some kind of electrical discharge over there?\"  Kraskov asked, his speech slightly labored from the climb up the ridge.", "\"Nah, nah,\" Mickelson replied, \"When a bunch of my readings start goin' haywire, it just means somethin's causing interference.  Could be a large deposit of magnetite, could be a Martian with a ray gun, ya' just never know.\"", "Jackson watched as Rickles' shook her head as they came upon the slope of the crater.  It wasn't exactly difficult to move or climb in the Martian gravity, hell, they had hundreds of hours in training with dealing with the lessened gravity, but the real thing was different.  They both began their slow ascent, following in the tracks of Kraskov, who had disturbed the soil ahead of them.", "The radio squelched to life, \"Uh, Commander?\" Kraskov's voice emanated from the speakers in Jackson's helmet.", "\"Go ahead,\" Jackson said.", "\"There's definitely something strange in here.\"", "\"Be there in a second.\"", "Rickles and Jackson trudged their way up, to where Kraskov stood at the top of the ridge, looking down and into the crater.  The view was magnificent.  The crater was decently sized, but not big enough to where it just became part of the landscape.  Jackson could see the ridge of the crater curve away in front of him, contrasting with the hazy orange of the horizon before sloping down into the classic bowl shape.  ", "Down in the middle of the bowl, Jackson expected to see rocks.  This wasn't the first crater they had explored, as Mars was littered with meteor strikes.  They hadn't expected this one to be here though, as he had memorized the general layout of their work area, and this one wasn't on the map.", "There was something metallic glinting in the sun in the center of the crater, they were still too far away to make out many details but Jackson could make out sharp angles on the metallic object.  Jackson shrugged as he looked between his two companions.  \"Welp, not going to see anything from up here.  Let's get going.\"", "They started down the slope, Jackson leading the way, Kraskov and Rickles following in his footsteps, sending billows of loose dust down around his ankles and down the slope.", "\"What's going...  Comman... ackson.\" The radio coughed through the speakers.", "\"Tex, I'm losing you.  There's something down in the crater and we're checking it out.\" Jackson replied.", "\"Read... interfer..\" the radio crackled and then became silent again.", "\"Too much interference,\" Kraskov said, \"the radio shouldn't be this weak, even heading down into the crater.  We're out of line of sight of the antenna, but it should be strong enough to overcome that.\"", "Jackson grunted as he scrambled over a large boulder and the slope of the crater eased away.  They were closer to the object now and could make out details.  It was roughly egg shaped, but only constructed in sharp angles.  It was made out of some kind of grey metal, which shone brightly in the sun. As they approached it loomed up and over them.", "\"Its got to be at least fifteen feet tall.\" Kraskov said, \"damn, how did the overhead satellites not pick this up?\"", "They approached slowly and Kraskov slowly circled around the large object.", "\n\"Nothing on the other side,\" He said as he came back into view, \"same angles, no hatch, console or anything.\"", "Rickles had her arm lifted as she recorded the object with the wrist mounted computer. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" she said, \"and I'm not getting any readings.

It slowly rotated another couple inches before coming to a rest.", "\"Whoa,\" Jackson said, \"I think I woke it up.\"", "It stood quiet for a few moments before each of its sharp angles turned into creases.  Gaps formed in the angles and widened.  Chunks of metal began falling off the object, starting from the top of the egg shape, clattering their way down and landing in clouds of orange dust.  Soon the chunks became larger until massive sections of the egg had fallen away, and the object was no more, only debris spread out before them.", "In the middle of the debris field was a round metal platform, sunk a few inches into the Martian soil.  Centered exactly in the center of the platform was another large metal egg, at least ten feet tall, but this time it was perfectly smooth, balanced perfectly on its base.", "\"What is that?\" Rickles said breathlessly.", "Jackson took a few steps closer, weaving his way through the debris of sharp metal and peered at the egg.   It had a mirror finish, the same grey metal as the previous egg, but this time there was engraving along one section of the egg.", "Kraskov stepped up beside Jackson and placed a hand on the shoulder of his space suit, and peered closer at the engraving.", "\"That...\" He started, gripping Jackson's shoulder tighter, \"That's Russian.\"", "Jackson could now make out the Russian lettering, above which was an engraving of the old USSR hammer and sickle insignia.", "\"What in the world is Russian tech doing on Mars?\" Kraskov asked, glancing at Jackson.", "Jackson could only shake his head, \"They've only sent orbiters, hell, even China has only sent one rover and that's on the other side of the planet.\" He paused for a second before continuing.  \"Crash, can you read it?\"", "Kraskov sighed and turned his attention back to the engraving, \"I haven't spoke or read Russian since I was a kid, but I'll give it a shot.\"", "He leaned in closer and brought up a finger, bouncing it along in the air as he combed over the engraving.  Jackson could see his mouth forming silent words through the glass of his visor as he made his way through the script.  Finally he lowered his hand and turned slowly to Jackson.", "\"Well,\" he said, \"you're not going to like this...\"", "I don't even know how we found it. Mars is a big planet, albeit not as big as Earth, but we did. The scythe and hammer. The questions flowed through my head at lightspeed. Why didn't the Soviets tell us what happened? Actually, why didn't they tell their people? Nobody knows. It seems that all known people who worked on Soviet space program disappeared.", "The discovery shocked the world more than the fact that we've actually reached Mars. There was a Russian on our team, Michail, and when we saw that half-bleached pink cloth, and found the hammer and scythe on it he laughed and said \"Vot syka, ebat' menya v zhopy\". No idea what that meant - but he was more shocked than me. ", "We got a message to NASA right away - they wanted to keep it a secret but I threatened to tell everyone, so they actually released the information. All the news channels were flooded for a whole week. The Internet exploded with conspiracy theories and reused jokes. Russian government issued a statement that they \"had not a single idea of how it was possible\" and Putin, probably the only bastard on the planet who remembers USSR, was asked about it on his visit to Washington. ", "While we were on Mars we did what you'd expect the Mars expedition to do - collected more samples, ran diagnostics, all that boring stuff. But every so often we would find some more evidence of the Soviet landing - a piece of radio equipment, a footprint in a cave or a buried used nuclear reactor. During the entire mission I felt that what I wanted to do my all life - something that nobody ever done before - was actually done seemingly a century ago. It wasn't something extraordinary - it was a second place, a \"participation trophy\".", "When I was going through a cave to collect some underground samples, I found... a glove. A fucking glove. On Mars. I wanted to go back and tell the others, but then I noticed the owner. He had his helmet shattered to tiniest pieces, but the face was preserved in the vacuum. I could make out all the features, the mole on his right cheek, the frozen eyes and dark brown hair. It was as if he died only hours ago. The suit had a Soviet red flag on it, but it was a very good one, not much different from what Russia used at the beginning of the 21st century.", "I was startled by the body, and forgot completely about calling the others. What happened to this guy? Was it an accident, or something more? I decided to go deeper into the cave. I know, stupid, how did I become an astronaut with this stupidity. But wouldn't you want to know? It's Mars, this was one of the first people to set foot on it, and he dies in a cave with a glove torn from the suit? Hardly seems likely. So, I started going. It wasn't easy. They cave wasn't fit for a spacesuit, so the pace was slow. But after about 10 minutes of crouching and walking I reached the end. That was it. The cave just ended, like they do on Earth. Except there was a sample collector in the wall. It was full, but untouched. The dead guy did find his way to the end of the cave, just like I did. But why didn't he take the samples? Why was his glove torn off near the entrance?", "I didn't want to waste time to take the new samples, so I just took the Soviet ones. It's important to not waste anything in space, okay? When I picked it up, the dust flew all around the cave. Yeah, imagine forgetting your laptop in a cave on Mars for a century, see how dusty it gets. I went back to crouch and walk to the top. As I reached the entrance, I saw a silhouette of one of my crew mates. \"Help me out with this one, will ya?\" I said. Little did I notice, that the dead astronaut was gone. Well, not gone. I still saw him. He was standing in the entrance, his silhouette black against the bright red sands of Mars...", "\"Neil Armstrong once said 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.'

It was important, and is what brought us here.\"", "\"I'm not knocking on what he did, just making an observation.

Over.\"", "\"We decided to explore the area a bit more. We found something else. Over.\"", "\"What is it, over.\"", "\"It's the body of one of the Soviet astronauts.

Dragging it out of its resting place, the Colonel tore it in half, showing the two men behind him a symbol of a gold hammer and sickle beneath a gold-bordered red star. ", "\"It can't be...\" said Lieutenant Colonel Haynes. \"Colonel, that's a soviet flag. A union of communist nations that dissolved nearly two hundred years ago.\"", "Colonel Anderson sighed and tried to stroke his gray beard, but remembered he was wearing a spacesuit. He then shook his head saying:", "\"I don't like this, Haynes. We're supposed to be the first humans here. What's a relic like this doing in Mars?\"", "\"Aliens?\" said Lieutenant Colonel Wilfery. \"Did they get killed off by aliens?!?\"", "Haynes rolled his eyes and said:", "\"There's no such thing as aliens, you dunce. Well, at least not on Mars. They probably had an accident and couldn't return back home.\"", "\"Maybe they were unable to contact Earth\" said Colonel Anderson. \"These... 'soviets' assumed the mission was a failure and never reported on it out of shame, or something like that. Regardless, that distress beacon is still pinging. We need to find its source before we do anything else.\" He scoffed with a sly grin. \"Maybe one of them is still alive.\"", "The three astronauts hiked a tall mountain they encountered on their way to the beacon. Gusts of wind suddenly caressed the men, causing them to be buffeted by specks of red sand. Ignoring the harsh exterior conditions inside the comfort of his spacesuit, Lieutenant Colonel Wilfery said:", "\"So why are you so sure there aren't any aliens here?\"", "\"Because of the rover Curiosity!\" replied Haynes, through a bit of static interference in their radio. \"About a hundred and fifty years ago it explored the martian surface and didn't find anything.\"", "\"A stoner's curiosity?\" said Wilfery. \"What's weed got to do with this? Did they really send an undergraduate student ahead of us?\"", "The gales rapidly increased in strength and ferocity the closer they got to the peak. Enveloping them in what seemed like crimson mist, the dust clouds got denser, to the point of almost being tangible, and obscured anything five meters ahead of them. Slamming his palm into his helmet, Haynes then said:", "\"Rover! R-O-V-E-R. It was a reconnaissance robot sent to study Mars' geology. It didn't find any life after decades of searching, so yeah, I'm pretty confident there aren't any aliens here!\"", "\"Would you two just shut up and focus on the situation at hand?!?\" shouted Colonel Anderson, barely visible in front of them. \"We're in the middle of a sandstorm here! One wrong step and we break our necks on this mountain!\"", "Just as he finished speaking, Colonel Anderson grabbed a loose rock and fell backwards. He screamed for his life while airborne, his horror subsiding once his men caught him by the arm. Wilfery grinned and said:", "\"Teaching by example, I see! A testament to your great leadership skills, colonel!\"", "Colonel Anderson narrowed his eyes and grunted at Wilfery, looking downwards in shame once his subordinates weren't looking. ", "Once they got to the peak, the sandstorm had already subsided, making the descent a lot easier than the climb. The distress signal was beeping stronger the more they walked through the empty plains, giving Wilfery an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. Marching behind the others didn't help his uneasiness. His back was exposed to whatever could be behind them and everything was too quiet, too still for his liking. The flat landscape they traversed looked more like a desert drenched in dried blood than an alien planet. Even the ground beneath his feet felt ", ". It was probably the difference in gravity to Earth's, but he still couldn't ignore the thought that everything reacted differently here. ", "Looking over his shoulder, Wilfery widened his eyes with fear. The soil turned pitch black and flowed in bumps towards them, rising and falling like streaks of ink in a hostile sea of red dust. Wilfery immediately ran to his companions screaming:", "\"The soil guys! The ground's out to get us!\"", "Haynes turned around with tense shoulders, but quickly relaxed his body. He then shook his head, sighed, and said:", "\"No it isn't. The ground isn't sentient Wilfery, it's just subterranean water rising from the ground.\"", "\"Subterranean water?\"", "\"Yeah,\" replied Haynes. \"they're called 'Recurring Slope Lineae'. It's summer here, and highly saline water tends to flow this way during this time of the year.\"", "Colonel Anderson laughed loudly and walked up to the darkened sand. He then touched its damp texture and said:", "\"I can't believe you're a Lieutenant, Wilfery. Really? Wet sand? What's next? An abandoned soviet station filled with zombi-\"", "The sand sprung from the ground and pierced Anderson's suit through his arm. He quickly jumped away from it, but it was already too late. The dust flowed into his spacesuit, filling it up until inflating it slightly and freezing him there with its added weight. Anderson's ear piercing screams were then muffled by the sand, who choked the life out of him by forcing itself down his throat. ", "Wilfery and Haynes gaped in terror, seeing Anderson's eyes pop out and being followed by a viscous fluid that fell from his sockets like crude oil. They turned around, trying to run away, but their knees weakened and tripped them over. The sand inched its way to their helmets, twisting itself around their calves and anchoring them to the ground. Clawing at the floor with their hands, they dragged themselves away from the black tendrils for a few feet, before being forcefully drawn into the darkness again.", "The two men then faced each other and nodded, silently resigning themselves to their end. Once the black sand reached their necks, it covered them like a blanket and stopped crushing them with its pressure. Footsteps suddenly crunched nearby, coming from Anderson's body who stood in front of them. In a coarse and headache inducing voice his body said:", "\"Get out of our planet, humans. It belongs to ", "!\"", "\"W-we come in peace\" said Wilfery. \"Yes, its ", " planet.

If it was real, I should already be hearing screams of joy of numerous conspiracy theorists, dancing and throwing their foil hats into the air.", "\"Sixteen days ago we found an artificial object on Mars. It is very unlikely to have been delivered by any unmanned mission we are aware about. There are no known landing sites in its vicinity.

Perhaps we will have to send another rover equipped specifically for this mission now that we know what to look for.\"", "\"Anyway, we have found an artifact, it took us sixteen days to get to it and inspect it.

Unfortunately we can't examine the flag itself as it is too high, all that's available is the pole.\"", "\"And so we did it. We analyzed the pole. It is very likely to be something like wood, something that was alive once.\" He draws a deep breath. \"And it definitely isn't from Earth.\"", "\"... and so it is that we find ourselves in the position to be able to introduce Polkovnik Vladimir Komorov to the platform.

If any of the guards thought it was strange that he looked so happy after a launch failure far above, they kept it to themselves.", "(Continued)", "Sarah crested the red ridge and her heart burst. She had almost literally moved mountains to be here. And now the rocks, sand and dust she had memorized for years lay before her. Her view from the southern slope of Olympus Mons stretched for kilometers--though that seemed too small a unit to measure what she could see. It felt like she could see for light years. She could feel the stretch of time and space across this ancient landscape. She could feel it stretch across her own landscape, tracing her journey from the wheat fields of Washington, where she learned her love of the stars, through the naval academy and, eventually, here on the fourth rock from the sun.", "She felt she could see everything, but soon only one thing dominated her vision: something that looked like--but could not possibly be--a metal pole with a red and yellow flag drooping to its side.", "Sarah called out, \"Jordan, I'm climbing down a klick to a crater that may have some exposed metal.\" \"Sure thing, Skip.\"", "The object that could not have been a flagpole was nestled into a crater, and looked like it would be in the shadows almost the entire day.  Sarah had only caught a small glint from the top few millimeters of the pole that was in the light, but it was enough.", "As she climbed down, she thought about all the factors that had brought her so far: the dissolution of NASA and the privatization of the American space program, the food shortages in Asia that had destabilized a third of the world's population, and the wild hope that low-grav farming on Mars would someday solve the problems on Earth.  While she was not on Mars to prospect for metals, the Mars First Consortium would not say no to anything useful.  And so she descended under the guise that she was prospecting.  She knew the truth though--whatever she was chasing was far above and beyond her pay grade.", "She reached the crater and found what she would have called a path to the floor of the crater, except there weren't any paths on Mars.  She reached the floor of the crater, and all her instruments went dark.  Her rebreather was working fine, it could handle a power outage, but coms, lights, and navigation were all off.  She tried to reboot her suit, to no avail.  Things were weird enough, so she decided to press on the 50 meters to the \"flagpole\" anyway.", "Sarah had walked over all kinds of Martian dust, or sand or gravel, but she hadn't seen anything like the bottom of the crater.  It was oddly smooth, as if it had been sanded down and polished, with a thin layer of dust to coat it and a few rocks and boulders strewn around for show.  She couldn't shake the feeling that she should be anywhere but in that crater, out of the sunlight, with no communications.  She was not exactly afraid, she just had that old familiar feeling that what she was about to do was intensely stupid and yet inevitable she would do it.  It was like when she ate a whole ghost pepper on Charlie's dare on her honeymoon.  A terrible decision, but one she had to make anyway.  Come to think of it, Charlie himself was one of those terrible decisions.", "She reached the flagpole.  There was no denying it any longer.  It was about five feet high, perfectly cylindrical in shape, and of course there was no mistaking the hammer and sickle flag that indicated the Soviets (or someone pretending to be them) had marked their time in this crater.", "Another stupid decision: she touched the pole.  A jolt ran through her finger, up her arm and through her body.  That wasn't supposed to be possible with the padding in her glove, but she found herself splayed on the ground shaking anyway.  Actually, she wasn't shaking, the ground was.  She tried to get to her feet as a thicker darkness rose around her and swallowed the skies above her, but it was no use.  She was being lowered underground.  All she could do was wait it out.", "Sarah sat, and waited, well away from the flagpole (she wasn't making that mistake again).  She may have dozed off, it felt like she was descending for hours, or it might have been a couple of minutes.", "Finally, her platform reached its destination.  A door opened into a spartan metallic corridor with blinding incandescent lights.  Sarah took a moment to adjust her eyes and began to explore the corridor.  She was familiar enough with Russian design from her days training for the ISS that she could see many of the same influences.  There was something to the platform, the shape and color of the metal, the design (or lack thereof) of the panels making up the corridor, that gave her a nostalgic feeling of training for a Soyuz mission.", "She reached a door to another room.  It was ajar.  She pushed it open and gasped.  On a series of ancient monitors, yet in surprisingly high definition, she watched as pivotal moments of her life played out: her first kiss, her graduation, the moment she knew she had to divorce Charlie to achieve her dreams...  The room looked and felt old.  The monitors had even older terminals with keyboards set in Russian, though a few looked newer and seemed to have standard Qwerty keyboards in English.  The chairs were steel and looked exceedingly uncomfortable, but looked as if they were polished yesterday.  Sarah's eyes were drawn back to the monitors, where the center screen flashed a message in English.", "\"Hello Sarah, we have been waiting for you...\"", "\"Hello? Who is there?\" Sarah said, once in English and once in Russian.", "A new message flashed onto the screen, \"We are.\"", "\"Who is 'we'?\"", "\"Come and see for yourself...\"  A small, unassuming door towards the rear of the room opened with a click and a hiss.  Sarah felt compelled to step through.  She still hadn't shaken the feeling that she should just run away and hide, but her curiosity was overwhelming.", "She entered the back room, her stomach dropping out when she saw what it contained.  Three grotesque Russian men stood before her.  They each had ugly steel and metals protruding from their bodies at odd angles in odd places, with plastic tubing ferrying liquids throughout their bodies.  Their military uniforms were tattered.  It seemed their backs were impossibly straight.  Each man's eyes had been replaced by small metallic balls that twirled constantly.  Their mouths were wired shut, and they had antennas sticking out of their skulls.  It looked as if they had an intake port shunted into their necks.  They were expressionless and, strangely enough, held hands with each other.  And the man in the center had a screen affixed to his chest.", "Another message: \"We are the Sputnik.  We want to go home.\"  Sarah's heart ached for the men these once were.  \"The process for conversion was imperfect for these bodies, but we have refined our techniques in the past decades.\"  Sarah's feeling of dread doubled.  The door closed behind her.  \"We have been watching you and waiting.  You have the determination to succeed where we did not.  And you have brought us a ship to get home.\"  Sarah tugged at the door to get out of the room as the bodies slowly slid toward her, their legs never moving from the ground.  \"Our people abandoned us, but you will not.  You will lead us into the new age.\"  The things that were once men closed in around her.  She heaved at the door once more, digging her feet in, and the latch broke.
