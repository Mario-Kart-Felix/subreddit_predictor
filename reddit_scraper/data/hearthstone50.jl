I think you'll be surprised how much your outlook on the game changes when you plan to spend $50/mo on packs. The main thing it does is vastly shrink the amount of time it takes to get cards. You'll notice the effect scales as well. Begin to spend $200/mo, $1000/mo or more on packs, and you'll notice you have 4 to 20 times as much dust as before you started. ", "Personally, I think the fact that you can pay cash for packs is one of the game's best-kept secrets. Most people don't even seem to realize that you can get more and more cards just by paying!

It doesnt matter if you and another 500, 1000 or 10 000 stop playing if 20 000 more new players come. People are right on one thing, you can make them change things if you stop playing but there arent nearly enough players to do it. Maybe if this whole subreddit by some miracle stopped playing blizzard would do something but they dont care about you. Im sorry but they dont, they care about quantity not quality of their players obviously. Even when you say that you will stop playing or make a poll and 500 000 people would vote they  wont play anymore chances are minimum 50% of them are bullshitting right after they realize there isnt really any good alternative to HS and they already have big part of their collection build up.", "I think a good start would be to increase the dust value for disenchanting commons. Why is it that every other rarity can be disenchanted for 25% of its value but commons only 12.5%? An extra ~20 dust per pack would make a not insignificant difference in people's ability to craft new cards. ", "Just a reminder that Gwent gives you 100 gold for the first three wins each day.

I hear the comparisons to other TCGs but it's not relevant. This is a video game and at this point just a gross cash grab by Blizzard. Even if I had the means and desire to come back, the business model alone is enough to keep me from that. To me, the game has reached the point of so many other free to play games. The economics of it has turned me away. ", "When the next expansion comes(versus adventure) is when it will really start to hurt.

I wasn't going to use a large portion of my luxury money on the game just to get the newer cards to be able to play the game that I'd already spent a ton of money on previously.
