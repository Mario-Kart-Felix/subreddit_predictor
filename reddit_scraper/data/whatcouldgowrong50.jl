He walked back out of the water and calmly explained that now he had to tug on the car in little yanks to slowly break the suction holding it back.  He said if he tried to pull it out all at once he would break his cable and have to charge me for that.  It took about 10 minutes to get the car back up on hard sand and another 10 for it to drain.  ", "Miraculously, it started after the guy used an air hose to dry out the distributor.  What happens when a car with a hot engine and transmission submerges in cold seawater is interesting. The engine was fine.  Most of the sand suspended in the water was caught by the air filter.  No water got into the gas tank, and although there was some that got into the cylinders, it didn't fill any and was pumped out without locking up the engine.  The driver told me I'd saved the engine when I shut it off before the rising water killed it.  What suffered was the transmission.  Turns out there is an air vent pipe that comes out the top of the transmission and goes up a foot or so under the car, then turns back down so stuff doesn't run down it into the works.  That's all good, but when the cold seawater rapidly cooled the hot transmission, it lowered the air pressure in the empty spaces inside it and turned that vent pipe into a suction hose that took in seawater mixed with sand.  \"Sand in the gears\" is an old expression that means \"all fucked up\" and now I know why.", "The car would move only if I put the shift lever in 2.
