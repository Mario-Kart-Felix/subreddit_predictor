So you say \"I should get my fair share.\" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, \"everyone should get their fair share.\" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!\nThe problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"only I should get my fair share\", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that \"everyone should get their fair share,\" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.\nThat's the situation of the \"black lives matter\" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.\nThe problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightcrawler? You know the part where Renee Russo tells Jake Gyllenhal that she doesn't want footage of a black or latino person dying, she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged white woman being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don't treat all lives as though they matter equally.\nJust like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"black lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: it's saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying \"all lives matter\" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means \"only black lives matter,\" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying \"all lives matter\" as a direct response to \"black lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.\nTL;DR: The phrase \"Black lives matter\" carries an implicit \"too\" at the end; it's saying that black lives should also matter. Saying \"all lives matter\" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to.", "While I can't explain it as eloquently as others have, here's a simpler one... when you hear someone say \"Save the rainforest\", do you think they mean \"fuck all of the other trees\"?  When you see a bumper sticker that says \"watch for motorcycles\", do you think they mean \"ignore everything else on the road\"?", "They believe people that say that are deliberately misinterpreting their message and/or trying to derail their cause. Original BLM activists never said ONLY black lives matter (to my knowledge). They were trying to call attention to a specific type of problem (cops killing black people without justification). That was their narrow focus.", "The whole situation has devolved into a huge mess. Anybody can claim to be part of BLM, so there are people out there doing shitty things and giving the rest of them a bad name. It reminds me of  Occupy Wall Street. Not really any formal group structure or leadership, so the message gets lost and the members are mocked and marginalized. Additionally, some people don't believe the problem exists at all - e.g. the black people getting shot by police are doing something bad and shouldn't have put themselves in that situation in the first place.", "I had an interesting interaction with the \"All Lives Matter\" crowd on my social media back when those officers were shot in Texas and Louisiana. Of course their response was to start posting \"Blue Lives Matter\" memes, changing their profile picture, etc.", "So, one day I simply asked why officer's lives were more important than EMS, fire, or service members dying over seas/committing 22 suicides a day?", "The response I got back was to the effect of \"Those are all very important, too. However, right now, the issue of cops being shot is more pressing since it's on everyone's minds and the news media.\"", "I then kind of retorted with \"hm...does any of this seem vaguely familiar to you guys?\", which fell on deaf ears. Not even the slightest hint of irony. One of the gentleman who responded was an actual county Sheriff. Not a deputy. The actual elected fucking Sheriff. It just did not compute that they were basically saying the same fucking shit. ", "So, I proceeded to pop open a bottle of Jameson and looked at flights to Tasmania.

It's not that the house is more important than the ones around it, it's simply the one most in need of attention. So when the firetrucks pull up and start to hose down that house, \"all lives matter\" is basically the neighbors nearby coming out and complaining that THEIR houses aren't getting equal attention.", "I saw something, I believe on Reddit, but I can't exactly recall where.

If a white man is murdered, it makes headlines.", "The more extreme - and provocative - example of \"society doesn't care about the lives of black people\" is the allegation (again, whether true or not) that police officers kill black men with impunity and without cause, and are not punished for it.", "So that's the first part.  Their argument is that society values white lives more than black lives.

Because racial discrimination does exist, and BLM seeks to remedy that, any attempts to counter them would, logically, be racist.", "However, the world is not purely polarized.  At best, \"All lives matter\" is a fallacious counterargument - answering a question to which BLM was not asking, and dismissing the question as answered.  At worst, it's a deliberate and intentional contortion of BLM's ideals to paint them as self-interested.  If I were to imagine motives for the latter (economic, capitalistic, societal, legal, legislative, electoral, or for law enforcement), any conscious twisting of the argument would be deliberately suppressing the black minority.  Whether it's to silence an inconvenient political group, to restrain a population segment's income so they buy your product, or just plain irrational hatred, deliberately suppressing a minority is racism.

Saying a white person can't champion their cause is still discrimination when there's no rational basis to support it (\"You're not one of us\" has limited, though sometimes valid, rational basis).

That said, I don't have a solution to these problems.", "The point of the phrase \"black lives matter\" is to say that \"black lives matter ", "\"\nThe argument being that it is a given that white lives matter in this country, as white people don't experience systematic, institutionalized racism as black people and other minority groups do.", "When you say \"all lives matter\" it takes away from the issues that \"black lives matter\" is putting a spotlight on. ", "The closest example I've heard of why \"all lives matter\" is in bad taste is;  you wouldn't go to a breast cancer rally and start telling everyone that all cancers matter.

", "If my goal is to save the pandas, making a sign saying \"Save the Animals\" doesn't put any focus on the pandas. Black people are being killed by the police. Not everyone else but specifically blacks are who are getting targeted. Using a general term in place of a specific term takes all of the focus away from it.", "[removed]", "Seems like you've gotten a lot of good answers. Here's an analogy I heard once. \"Black lives matter is like... If a house in a neighborhood was on fire, would the fire department put the water on all of the houses, because all houses matter? No, they'd put the water on the house that's burning because that's the house that needs it the most.\"", "The phrase \"black lives matter\" is directed at police forces. It is to bring attention to the fact that black people and other minorities are disproportionately and unfairly targeted by the police and is a form of discrimination. Saying \"all lives matter\", while certainly true, doesn't emphasize the issue of police brutality against the black community. It doesn't make you a racist to say \"all lives matter\", but it does distract from the purpose of the original phrase to point out discrimination. By bringing up the alternative of \"all lives matter\", it sends the message that you either wish to hide the plight of African Americans or outright deny it all together. So in some ways it's a marketing issue. If they started with \"all lives matter\" it wouldn't be connected to black people. If they decided to use \"only black lives matter\" or \"black lives matter too\" one would be racist and the other wouldn't really pack enough punch for a slogan. \"Black lives matter\" is strong and direct and nobody thinks that those who say the phrase are also implying other races don't matter. ", "Because it is just an ignorant statement to make. Of course, all lives matter, but this is not the topic of conversation. By saying \"All lives matter\" you are not contributing to the discussion and are simply shutting up the ones who say \"Black lives matter\"", "Furthermore, it is also relevant to acknowledge that NOBODY went around saying \"All lives matter\" before \"Black lives matter\" became a thing. Mass shootings? War? Refugees? Nobody cared, but when it comes to race people immediately needed to defend themselves instead of engaging the problem.

", "The reason is because they are trying to frame the issue as one of the police being racist rather than it being about the nature of training cops receive, their increased militarization in recent decades and the closing of ranks among police and District Attorney's offices in the past when incidents happened leading to expectations of a lack of accountability.", "I personally think police violence stems from the latter causes far more than the former and the problem will never be fixed if we do not address those root causes. Focusing on racism where it is not the key factor while ignoring everything else will not fix anything, and can only make things worse, as we are seeing with attacks on police and incidents like that female officer up North who got the shit kicked out of her because she didn't want to draw her firearm on a dude fucked out of his mind on angel dust because of the possible repercussions of using deadly force to her department and family.", "Because it's assumed that life matters, and black people are routinely treated as though their lives don't matter (by police, the establishment, etc).", "There's a \"too\" that goes unsaid at the end of BLM."], "SUBREDDIT": "OutOfTheLoop", "SCORE": 8597, "TOTAL": 711, "TYPE": 1}

Now, there's like 10 different bundles a month so the novelty of the idea has been completely sterilized. It doesn't feel exciting anymore. It feels watered down. It feels like in efforts to have so many different bundles that often the bundles don't feel as good, like they are spread too thin. Or, there is one really good bundle and it makes all the rest feel like crap. Often bundles are recycled. Often now, in efforts to keep up the quantity of the bundles, there are tons of repeat games from previous bundles, which again, waters it down a little.", "I feel like this is what happened to TED. It was a cool idea, still is, but then with the popularity of them rising it felt like overnight every motivational speaker in the world decided they needed to co-opt the TED thing and all of a sudden you were getting sub-par TEDx people. Not all of them were bad, but it was like before you had some world class, world famous scientist talk about some recent breakthroughs that were about to be published, and then all of a sudden, on every university campus in the country, was a round of TEDx speakers that were like, \"Let me tell you how I managed to succeed in life with Cerebral Palsy.\" Nothing wrong with that. I bring that up because that dude's talk was extremely motivational and inspirational. However, it was not a TED talk, it was a motivational speaker who had been invited to speak at TEDx because that is what TEDx turned into, motivational talks rather than necessarily cutting edge scientists. You youtube TED talks and 90% of what you find now is TEDx stuff that doesn't necessarily carry the same weight as the TED stuff. Furthermore, the lack of quality controls of TEDx hurt the brand even further, imo.", "Not sure if it is all due to this, but I believe this may possibly be why:", "TED talks are organised by the TED people themselves and each one is approved, monitored and planned. They often are at larger events and have larger audiences than TEDx talks. TEDx talks can be held by any local community (such as a school). All the community needs to do is get a licence from TED. This means TEDx talks are less regulated and it's easier get into than going through the TED screening process, leading to less quality content.", "Yea, all of these are contributing factors but I think the main one is that TED presents a future which we don't experience. It shows what can be done or how things should be and then we wait excitedly for these things to become more widespread. But, that never happens. We never see the plan put into action on a large scale. This isn't totally TED and the presenters at TED's fault, it's just the reality of our society.

This is what I observed: 1.) woman gets on the plane pushing a car seat type stroller with one child in it, carrying a second child on her hip and dragging behind a very large folded stroller that was too big for the overhead bin or to go under a seat. 2.) the flight attendant shown in the video approached from the back of the plane and informed her in a calm manner that there was nowhere to store the stroller. The woman immediately escalated the situation and within about 30 seconds was screaming at him at the top of her lungs. 3.) the flight attendant evidently decided she was not fit to be on the flight (in my opinion the correct decision) and started to move her and her children towards the front of the plane. 4.) when they got to the from of the plane the woman decided she was not going any further. The flight attendant picked up the stroller and lifted it over his head to try and move past the woman. As he was doing this she pushed him and the stroller fell a bit and struck her in the face. She began crying loudly and dramatically. Shortly after this is where the video begins. 5.) The first class passenger then inserts himself into the drama with his faux chivalry but clearly has no idea what has transpired in the back of the plane since he was in a window seat in the first class section of the plane and could not have viewed the incident from his seat. 6.) after another 10 minutes or so the woman exits the plane only to be returned about 5 minutes later and taken to her seat. We wait another 30-40 minutes while various flight and ground crew come and go speaking to the woman. After about 40 minutes she deplanes again this time telling all of the passengers, who are now becoming vocal in support of the flight crew, that all she wanted was an apology from the flight attendant. Evidently that's what the 40 minute delay was all about. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the ground crew to find and remove her luggage from the belly of the plane. 7.) the flight finally leaves and arrives in Dallas an hour or so late. American representatives are waiting at the gate to speak with the first class passenger who made the threats. What I heard was a very apologetic tone coming from two American employees, as if the airline had done something to upset the first class passenger. 8.) when I entered the bag claim area the first class passenger was right in front of me and as soon as he made it through the revolving door there was a camera crew waiting for him on the other side to interview him. That's about as factual of an account as I can provide and I realize there may be other parts of this story that I do not know about or did not witness. From what I saw: a.) if anyone from American should have been punished it should be the ground crew who somehow letting this woman on board with a full size stroller. The flight attendant was put in a horrible situation by a passenger that most passengers in my immediate area thought seemed unstable. She escalated the situation, not him. b.) in my opinion, the first class passenger should have been removed. Had the flight been in progress he might very well have been arrested upon landing for threatening a crew member. Additionally, he could not have seen any of the back of the plane antics of the woman based on where he was seated. c.) I agree the flight attendant may have reacted too harshly in responding to the threatening customer in first class, but his actions with the woman in question were professional throughout the ordeal. I am disappointed American has chosen to punish him. If this eyewitness source is to be believed (and I don't know about you, I'm trusting the witness more than the lady who is overreacting), the lady clearly got on with a stroller way too big for an overhead or under a seat. The flight attendant calmly informed her that it was too big to fit in the bins. She immediately escalated said situation and stated screaming at this flight attendant. (Overreaction, a little?) The flight attendant decided to kick her off (which I agree with, along with the eyewitness), and started to move them to the front of the plane, where the lady stopped. The flight attendant took the stroller and moved it over his head to get it off of the plane, and this is where the lady pushed him, causing the stroller to hit her lightly in the head. She then proceeded to bawl and cry like a 3 year old. This is where the video/gif starts. The first class passenger decides to fight on her side, with literally no idea of what went down, and this is where the gif explains itself. The lady then proceeds to get back on, and then causes a 1 hour delay, with the entire plane cheering for the flight crew. At landing, there were several American reps to talk to the passenger as if they pissed him off. The rest of that eyewitness account is mostly opinion. And to add insult to injury, the flight attendant was suspended. All over a lady playing obvious victim in order to get a lot of lawsuit money after what happened on United Airlines. I'm not saying the UA disaster was right, it was certainly wrong, but this isn't a disaster, this isn't brutality, this is someone playing victim.

The flight attendant told her she could not have the stroller on the plane and he needs to take it.  She refused to let him take it and was to the near point of shouting.   The flight attendant shouted up for security very soon on, escalating the situation more (he should have been working on deescalating)", "The flight attendant and the woman started making their way to the front of the plane (I forgot who had the stroller at this point).

The woman was refusing to let it go and made an aggressive move grabbing the flight attendant (which she should not have done)   This angered him and he responded by jerking the stroller harder knocking the Argentinian woman in the head and nearly missing her kids.
