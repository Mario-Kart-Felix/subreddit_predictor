Anti-aircraft warfare requires some serious artillery power so these blockhouses were equipped with at least eight 128 mm guns, with a range of around 14 km, and up to 32 20 mm guns covering 360 degrees.

Their three and a half meter thick walls meant, too, that they could be used as above ground air-raid shelters by civilians. They saved lives as well as destroying them.
